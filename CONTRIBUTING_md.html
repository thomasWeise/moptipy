Our project is developed for scientific, educational, and industrial applications.<h2>1. Contributing</h2><p>One of the pillars of our project is extensive documentation, the implementation of many style-guides, the use of unit tests, and the use of many static code analysis tools. Our <a href=./Makefile.html>make build</a> requires the code to pass the checks of more than <a href=./index.html#unit-tests-and-static-analysis>20 tools</a>. This may make it complicated to submit code contributions via git pull requests.<p>The preferred way to contribute to this project therefore is by opening <a href=https://github.com/thomasWeise/moptipy/issues>issues</a>.<p>If you nevertheless submit a git pull or otherwise code-based contribution, then it should ideally pass all these checks. In other words, the <a href=./Makefile.html>make build</a> requires the code to pass the checks of more than <a href=./index.html#unit-tests-and-static-analysis>20 tools</a> should succeed on your local system.<p>If that is not possible, you can still submit the pull request or otherwise code-based contribution. However, we will then need to invest more work to manually check to see how and whether it can be integrated into our code base. On the one hand, this may take quite some time. On the other hand, it may also mean that we eventually reject the request and manually integrate a very modified version of the code -- but we would of course give proper credit. Finally, it could also turn out that we simply cannot integrate the contribution at the current time. We will, however, definitely try our best.<p>We believe that, in the long run, having very clearly documented code that follows best practices and is thoroughly tested wherever possible will benefit the value of our project. The downside is that it takes a lot of resources, time, and nit-picking energy.<p>If your contribution concerns the <em>security</em> of <code>moptipy</code>, please consider our <a href=./SECURITY_md.html>security policy</a>.<h2>2.
