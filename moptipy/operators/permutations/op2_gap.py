"""
This binary operator merges two permutations by adding elements in sequence.

Assume we have two permutations `x0` and `x1`. For each position `i` in the
destination string `dest`, we randomly select the permutation `x` from which
the value should come (so either `x=x0` or `x=x1`). We then store the first
value not yet marked as done from `x` in `dest[i]`, mark that value as
done both in `x0` and `x1`.

This operator may be considered as a generalized version of the Alternating
Position Crossover operator (AP) for the Traveling Salesperson Problem by
Larrañaga et al. (1997). The original AP operator, as described by Larrañaga
et al., simply creates an offspring by selecting alternately the next element
of the fist parent and the next element of the second parent, omitting the
elements already present in the offspring. For example, if `x0` is `12345678`
and `x1` is `37516824`, the AP operator gives the following offspring
`13275468`. Exchanging the parents results in `31725468`.

Our generalized version randomly decides which of the two parent permutations
to use each time, hopefully resulting in a greater variety of possible results.
It also does not skip over a parent if its next element is already used, but
instead picks the next not-yet-used element from that parent.
As mnemonic for the operator, we use `gap`. Larrañaga et al. used `AP` for the
version of the operator that strictly alternates between parents.
