"""
An operator deleting an element from a permutation and inserting it elsewhere.

The operator is similar to a combination of the `rol` and `ror` operators
in [1]. If the permutation represents, e.g., a tour in the Traveling
Salesperson Problem (TSP), then a rotation replaces two edges (if two
neighboring elements are rotated = swapped) or three edges (if at least three
elements take part in the rotation). It may therefore be considered as a
possible 3-opt move on the TSP.

An alternative way to look at this is given in [2, 3, 4], where the operator
is called "Insertion Mutation": An element of the permutation is removed from
its current position (`i1`) and inserted at another position (`i2`). The
operator is therefore called "position based mutation operator" in [5].

    Rotate a portion of an array to the left or right in place.

    If `i1 < i2`, then a left rotation by one step is performed. In other
