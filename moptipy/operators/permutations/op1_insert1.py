"""
An operator deleting an element from a permutation and inserting it elsewhere.

The operator is similar to a combination of the `rol` and `ror` operators
in [1]. If the permutation represents, e.g., a tour in the Traveling
Salesperson Problem (TSP), then a rotation replaces two edges (if two
neighboring elements are rotated = swapped) or three edges (if at least three
elements take part in the rotation). It may therefore be considered as a
possible 3-opt move on the TSP.

An alternative way to look at this is given in [2, 3, 4], where the operator
is called "Insertion Mutation": An element of the permutation is removed from
its current position (`i1`) and inserted at another position (`i2`). The
operator is therefore called "position based mutation operator" in [5].

    Copy `x` into `dest` and then rotate a subsequence by one step.

    The function repeatedly tries to rotate a portion of an array to the left
    or right in place. It will continue trying until something changed.
    In each step, it draws two indices `i1` and `i2`.

    If `i1 < i2`, then a left rotation by one step is performed. In other
    words, the element at index `i1 + 1` goes to index `i1`, the element at
    index `i1 + 2` goes to index `i1 + 1`, and so on. The lst element, i.e.,
    the one at index `i2` goes to index `i2 - 1`. Finally, the element that
    originally was at index `i1` goes to index `i2`. If any element in the
    array has changed, this function is done, otherwise it tries again.

    If `i1 > i2`, then a right rotation by one step is performed. In other
    words, the element at index `i1 - 1` goes to index `i1`, the element at
    index `i1 - 2` goes to index `i1 - 1`, and so on. Finally, the element
    that originally was at index `i1` goes to index `i2`. If any element in
    the array has changed, this function tries again, otherwise it stops.

    This corresponds to extracting the element at index `i1` and re-inserting
    it at index `i2`.
