"""
An operator swapping two elements in a permutation.

This is a unary search operator which first copies the source string `x` to
the destination string `dest`. Then it draws an index `i1` randomly.
It keeps drawing a second random index `i2` until `dest[i1] != dest[i2]`,
i.e., until the elements at the two indices are different. This will always
be true for actual permutations if `i1 != i2`, but for permutations with
repetitions, even if `i1 != i2`, sometimes `dest[i1] == dest[i2]`. Anyway,
as soon as the elements at `i1` and `i2` are different, they will be swapped.

This operator is very well-known for permutations and has been used by many
researchers, e.g., for the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). In the papers
by Larrañaga et al. (1999) and Banzhaf (1990), it is called "Exchange
Mutation." It is also referred to as the "swap mutation" (Oliver et al. 1987),
point mutation operator (Ambati et al. 1991), the reciprocal exchange mutation
operator (Michalewicz 1992), or the order based mutation operator by Syswerda
(1991).
