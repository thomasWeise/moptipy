"""
An operator trying to change exactly `n` elements in a permutation.

This is an operator with a step size
(:class:`moptipy.api.operators.Op1WithStepSize`) and the step size determines
how many elements of a permutation should be changed.
If you are working on permutations without repetitions, the operator in
:mod:`~moptipy.operators.permutations.op1_swap_try_n` is the better and faster
choice. On normal permutations, it will be equivalent to
:mod:`~moptipy.operators.permutations.op1_swap_exactly_n`, but faster. On
Permutations with repetitions, it will still be faster but less precisely
enforces the number of swaps.

Let's say we have a "normal" permutation where each element occurs once.
The permutation has length `n`, let's say that its
:attr:`~moptipy.spaces.permutations.Permutations.blueprint` is
`[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., n-1]`. Then, with one application of the operator, we
can change no less than two elements (`step_size=0.0`) and no more than `n`
(`step_size=1.0`). Clearly we cannot change only one element, because what
different value could we put there? We would violate the "permutation nature."
We can also not change more than `n` elements, obviously.

What our operator does is then it computes `m` by using
:func:`~moptipy.operators.tools.exponential_step_size`.
This ensures that `m=2` for `step_size=0.0` and `m` is maximal for
`step_size=1.0`. In between the two, it extrapolates exponentially. This means
that small values of `step_size` will lead to few swap moves, regardless of
the length of the permutation and many swaps are performed only for
`step_size` values close to `1`.
Then it will pick `m` random indices and permute the elements at them such
that none remains at its current position.
That is rather easy to do.
Unfortunately, :class:`~moptipy.spaces.permutations.Permutations` allows also
permutations with repetitions. Here, things get dodgy.

Let's say we have the blueprint `[0, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. Then we can only change
exactly two elements.

>>> print(get_max_changes([0, 1, 1, 1, 1]))
2

If we have the blueprint `[0, 0, 1, 1, 1]`, then we can change two elements.
We can also change four elements. But there is no way to change three elements!

>>> print(get_max_changes([0, 0, 1, 1, 1]))
4

So in the general case, we determine the maximum number `mx` of positions that
can be changed with one move via the function :func:`get_max_changes`.
We can still translate a `step_size` to a number `m` by doing
`m = 2 + int(round(step_size * (mx - 2)))`.
However, it is not clear whether all moves from `m=2` to `m=mx` are actually
possible.

And even if they are possible, they might be very hard to sample randomly.
Some moves touching a large number `m` of positions may be restricted to
swap the elements at very specific indicies in a very specific order. Finding
such a move by chance may be rather unlikely.

Indeed, a search operator should do random moves. I did not find a way to
construct moves according to a policy which is both random and can yield any
move.
So I divide the operator into two steps:

First, the function :func:`find_move` tries to find a move for a given `m`
in a random fashion. This function tries to find the sequence of indices for a
cyclic swap where each element is different from both its successor and
predecessor. It builds such index sequences iteratively. This may fail:
as in the example above, for some values of `m` it might just not be
possible to construct a suitable sequence, either because there is none or
because building it randomly has too low of a chance of success. Hence, the
function tries to build at most `max_trials` sequences. Whenever building a
sequence, it also remembers the longest-so-far cyclic move. If that one is
shorter than `m` but all `max_trials` trials are exhausted, it returns this
sequence instead. So in summary, this function tries to find the longest
cyclic swap which is not longer than `m` and returns it. It may be shorter
than `m`. If we deal with permutations where each value occurs only once, this
function is guaranteed to find a sequence of length `m` in the first trial,
i.e., it does not waste runtime.

Once a move was found, the function :func:`apply_move` applies it. Now, as
said, :func:`find_move` discovers cyclic changes that are reasonably random.
However, cyclic changes are not the only possible moves of length `m`. For
example, if we have the permutation blueprint `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, a move of
length 4 could be to exchange `0` with `1` and to swap `2` with `3`.
:func:`find_move` cannot find this move, but it could find a cyclic swap of
`0` to `1`, `1` to `2`, `2` to `3`, and `3` to `1`. So it could find the
right indices for such a move, just restricted to the cyclic swapping. So
what :func:`apply_move` tries to do is to permute the indices discovered by
:func:`find_move` randomly and check whether this would still yield a feasible
move changing exactly `m` locations. Any shuffling of the elements at the
selected position which avoids putting the original values into the original
positions would do. Sometimes, most such shuffles work out, e.g., if we work
on the space of permutations where each element occurs once. Sometimes, the
only sequence that works is indeed the cyclic move and shuffling it cannot
work. So :func:`apply_move` again has a limit for the maximum number of
attempts to find a shuffle that works out. If it finds one, then it applies
it as move. If it does not find one and the trials are exhausted, it randomly
choses whether to apply the cyclic move as a cycle to the left or as a cycle
to the right. Either way, it will change exactly `m` positions of the
permutation, as prescribed by the move. Cycling one step in either direction
will always work, since each element is different from both its predecessor
and successor. (Cycling more than one step (but less than `m`) could
potentially fail in permutations with repetitions, because there is no
guarantee that any element is different from its successor's successor.)

Now the overall operator just plugs these two functions together. It also adds
one slight improvement: If we demand to change a number `q` of locations for
the first time and :func:`find_move` fails to find a move of length `q` but
instead offers one of length `p<q`, then the operator remembers this. The next
time we ask to change `q` positions, it will directly try to change only `p`.
This memory is reset in :meth:`~Op1SwapExactlyN.initialize`.

A similar but much more light-weight and faster operator is given in
:mod:`~moptipy.operators.permutations.op1_swap_try_n`. That operator also
tries to perform a given number of swaps, but puts in much less effort to
achieve this goal, i.e., it will only perform a single attempt.

    Find a move of at most step_size changes and store it in indices.

    For any pure permutation `x`, we can basically find any move between
    `step_size=2` and `len(x)`. If we have permutations with repetitions, the
    upper limit becomes smaller, because it may not be possible to change all
    elements at once. For example, in `[0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, we can change
    at most four elements. For this purpose, :func:`get_max_changes` exists.
    It tells us the upper limit of changes, which would be four here:

    >>> print(get_max_changes([0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]))
    4

    Yet, this does not necessarily mean that we can make all moves including
    2, 3, and 4 changes. If you look at the above example, you may find that
    it is impossible to change exactly 3 locations. We can only actually do
    step sizes of 2 and 4, but neither 3 nor 5, 6, nor 7.
    In reality, even if it was possible to make a big move, it might be very
    unlikely to be able to this in a *random* fashion. If you look at the
    code of :func:`get_max_changes`, it tries to find the longest possible
    cyclic move by working through the elements of the permutation in a very
    specific order. Using a different (or random) order would yield shorter
    moves.

    Our method :func:`find_move` here therefore tries to find the longest
    possible cyclic swap involving at most `step_size` indices. It may find
    such a move that uses exactly `step_size` indices. But it may also find
    a shorter move because either the perfect complete feasible move touching
    `step_size` indices does not exist or because finding it in a random
    fashion may take too long. (For this purpose, `max_trials` exists to
    limit the search for the right move.)

    For normal permutations, it will find the move of exactly the right
    length. For permutations with repetitions, it has a decent chance to find
    a move of the length `step_size` if a) such a move exists and
    b) `step_size` is not too big. Otherwise, it should find a shorter but
    still reasonably large move.

# rarely occurring element could then appear later in the move when there are
# not many other choices left. Hence, it might be that the moves found by
# find_move are not uniformly distributed over the realm of possible moves of
# a given step length. In this case, it may be useful to randomly choose
# whether to cycle left or right. We cannot cycle more than one step, though,
# because there is guarantee that an element is different from its successor's
# successor.
