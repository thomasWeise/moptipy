"""
An operator trying to swap a given number of elements in a permutation.

This operator is similar to
:mod:`~moptipy.operators.permutations.op1_swap_exactly_n`
in that it tries to swap a fixed number of elements in a permutation. It
implements the :class:`~moptipy.api.operators.Op1WithStepSize` interface.
Different from :mod:`~moptipy.operators.permutations.op1_swap_exactly_n`,
however, it does so less strictly. It applies a simple best-effort approach
and if that does not work out, then so be it. It is therefore faster, but
adheres less strictly to the give `step_size`.

This operator will always swap the right number of elements on normal
permutations. On permutations with repetitions, it enforces the number of
swaps less strongly compared to
:mod:`~moptipy.operators.permutations.op1_swap_exactly_n`, but it will be
faster either way.
