"""
A tool for selecting a consistent subset of data from partial experiments.

When we have partial experimental data, maybe collected from experiments that
are still ongoing, we want to still evaluate them in some consistent way. The
right method for doing this could be to select a subset of that data that is
consistent, i.e., a subset where the algorithms have the same number of runs
on the instances using the same seeds. The function :func:`select_consistent`
offered by this module provides the functionality to make such a selection.
It may be a bit slow, but hopefully it will pick the largest possible
consistent sub-selection or, at least, get close to it.

The current method to select the data is rather heuristic. It is based on
iteratively deleting those data elements whose configuration elements appear
the least often. This is computed in absolute terms. I actually think
normalizing this score should be better, but seemingly using the absolute raw
score creates larger consistent datasets. So for now, this is how we will do
it.

    Select data such that the numbers of runs are consistent.

    The input is a set of data items which represent some records over the
    runs of algorithms on instances. It may be that not all algorithms have
    been applied to all instances. Maybe the number of runs is inconsistent
    over the algorithm-instance combinations, too. Maybe some algorithms
    have more runs on some instances. Maybe the runs are even different,
    it could be that some algorithms have runs for seed `A`, `B`, and `C` on
    instance `I`, while others have runs for seed `C` and `D`. This function
    is designed to retain only the runs with seed `C` in such a case. It may
    discard algorithms or instances or algorithm-instance-seed combinations
    in order to obtain a selection of data where all algorithms have been
    applied to all instances as same as often and using the same seeds.

    Now there are different ways to select such consistent subsets of a
    dataset. Of course, we want to select the data such that as much as
    possible of the data is retained and as little as possible is discarded.
    This may be a hard optimization problem in itself. Here, we offer a
    heuristic solution. Basically, we step-by-step try to cut away the
    setups that are covered by the least amount of runs. We keep repeating
    this until we arrive in a situation where all setups have the same
    amount of runs. We then check if there were some strange symmetries that
    still make the data inconsistent and, if we found some, try to delete
    one run to break the symmetries and then repeat the cleaning-up process.
    In the end, we should get a list of overall consistent data elements that
    can be used during a normal experiment evaluation procedure.

    This iterative process may be rather slow on larger datasets, but it is
    maybe the best approximation we can offer to retain as much data as
    possible.
