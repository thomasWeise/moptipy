"""
Components for parsing and evaluating log files generated by experiments.

Via the :mod:`moptipy.api`, it is possible to log the progress or end
results of optimization algorithms runs in text-based log files.
With the methods in this package here, you can load and evaluate them. This
usually follows a multi-step approach: For example, you can first extract the
end results from several algorithms and instances into a single file via the
:class:`~moptipy.evaluation.end_results.EndResult`. This could then be
processed to per-algorithm or per-instance statistics using
:class:`~moptipy.evaluation.end_statistics.EndStatistics`.
