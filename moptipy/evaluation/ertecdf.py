Approximate the ECDF over the ERT to reach certain goals.

The empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF, see
:mod:`~moptipy.evaluation.ecdf`) is a function that shows the fraction of runs
that were successful in attaining a certain goal objective value over the
time. The (empirically estimated) Expected Running Time (ERT, see
:mod:`~moptipy.evaluation.ert`) is a function that tries to give an estimate
how long a given algorithm setup will need (y-axis) to achieve given solution
qualities (x-axis). It uses a set of runs of the algorithm on the problem to
make this estimate under the assumption of independent restarts.

Now in the ERT-ECDF we combine both concepts to join several different
optimization problems or problem instances into one plot. The goal becomes
"solving the problem". For each problem instance, we compute the ERT, i.e.,
estimate how long a given algorithm will need to reach the goal. This becomes
the time axis. Over this time axis, the ERT-ECDF displays the fraction of
instances that were solved.
