"""
The implementation of a (mu+lambda) Evolutionary Algorithm.

This is the basic `mu+lambda`-EA works as follows:

1. Start with a list `lst` of `mu` random records and `lambda` blank records.
2. In each iteration:
    2.1. Use the `mu` first records as input to the search operators to
         generate `lambda` new points in the search space:
         For each new point to be created, the binary operator is applied
         with probability `0<=br<=1` and the unary operator is used otherwise.

         Each of the `mu` records has the same chance to produce such a new
         point in the search space, but no record can be used again (in one
         iteration) until all other `mu-1` selected records have produced at
         least one point. In other words, if `lambda > mu`, then each of the
         `mu` selected record will produce at least `lambda // mu` offspring
         and at most `1 + lambda // mu`.
    2.1. Sort the list `lst` according to the objective value of the record.
         Ties are broken such that younger record are preferred over older
         ones (if they have the same objective value).

If `mu=1`, `lambda=1`, and `br=0`, then this algorithm is exactly equivalent
to the :class:`~moptipy.algorithms.rls.RLS` if the same unary and nullary
operator are used. It is only a bit slower due to the additional overhead of
maintaining a list of records.
