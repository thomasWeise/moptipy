"""
The implementation of an Evolutionary Algorithm without crossover.

This is the basic `mu+lambda`-EA, but without using the binary crossover
operator. It works as follows:

1. Start with a population of `mu+lambda` random individuals.
2. In each iteration:
    2.1. Shuffle the population to introduce randomness and fairness in the
         case that sorting is stable.
    2.2. Sort the population according to the objective value of the
         individuals. Ties are broken such that younger individuals are
         preferred over older ones (if they have the same objective value).
    2.3. Retain the best `mu` individuals (which will be the `mu` first
         individuals in the list) and overwrite the `lambda` worse ones
         (which will be at indices `mu...mu+lambda-1`). Each of these
         individuals is overwritten with the results of the unary operator
         applied to one of the `mu` "parents". Each of the `mu` parents has
         the same chance to produce such a new "offspring", but no individual
         can be used as a parent again until all other `mu-1` selected
         individuals have produced at least one offspring. In other words, if
         `lambda > mu`, then each of the `mu` selected individuals will
         produce at least `lambda // mu` offspring and at most
         `1 + lambda // mu`.

This EA only applies the unary search operator to sample new points in the
search space. Therefore, its population mainly guards against premature
convergence.
