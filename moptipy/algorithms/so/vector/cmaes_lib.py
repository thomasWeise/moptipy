Provides the CMA-ES Family Algorithms from the Library `cmaes`.

The Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary Strategy, CMA-ES for short, is a
very efficient optimization algorithm for small- and mid-scale and numerical/
continuous optimization problems.

Here, we wrap our `moptipy` API around the beautiful library `cmaes` by
Masashi Shibata and Masahiro Nomura at https://pypi.org/project/cmaes/. They
provide a CMA-ES implementation based on the ask-tell interface. In this
interface, you repeatedly query sample points in the search space from the
model and evaluate them. Then you feed back the points and their corresponding
objective values to the CMA-ES algorithm so that it can update its model. Then
the cycle is repeated.

    The Separable CMA-ES based on Class `SepCMA` from Library `cmaes`.

    This is a variant of the CMA-ES where the covariance matrix is
    constrained to be diagonal. This means that there are fewer parameters to
    learn, so the learning rate for the covariance matrix can be increased.
    This algorithm is suitable if the problem is of larger scale, i.e., has
    a high dimension, in which case the pure CMA-ES may become rather slow in
    terms of its runtime consumption. Then, the loss of solution quality
    resulting from the underlying assumption that the objective function is
    separable is acceptable versus the gain in speed. By learning only the
    diagonals of the covariance matrix, the implicit assumption is that there
    are no mutual influences between the different decision variables. Of
    course, if the optimization problem is already of that nature, i.e.,
    separable, the algorithm will be faster than the normal CMA-ES at the same
    solution quality.
