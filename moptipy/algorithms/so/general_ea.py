"""
A fully configurable, general (mu+lambda) Evolutionary Algorithm.

This evolutionary algorithm begins by sampling
:attr:`~moptipy.algorithms.so.ea.EA.mu`
solutions using the nullary search operation
:attr:`~moptipy.api.algorithm.Algorithm0.op0`. In each iteration, it then uses
:attr:`~moptipy.algorithms.so.ea.EA.mu` existing solutions as input for
the search operations, where, for each solution to be sampled, the binary
operation :attr:`~moptipy.api.algorithm.Algorithm2.op2` is used with
probability :attr:`~moptipy.algorithms.so.ea.EA.br` and (otherwise), the unary
operator :attr:`~moptipy.api.algorithm.Algorithm1` is used. The inputs of both
operators are chosen from the :attr:`~moptipy.algorithms.so.ea.EA.mu`
solutions using :attr:`~moptipy.algorithms.so.general_ea.GeneralEA.mating`
selection. After :attr:`~moptipy.algorithms.so.ea.EA.lambda_` new solutions
have been created this way (and have been evaluated as well), a fitness
assignment process (:class:`~moptipy.algorithms.so.fitness.Fitness`) assigns
fitness values to them based on their objective values
(:attr:`~moptipy.algorithms.so.record.Record.f`), maybe also using the index
of the iteration (:attr:`~moptipy.algorithms.so.record.Record.it`) in which
they were created. The survival selection
:attr:`~moptipy.algorithms.so.general_ea.GeneralEA.survival` then chooses,
from the joint set of `mu+lambda` solutions, the `mu` solutions for the
next iteration. Both mating and survival selection are instances of class
:class:`~moptipy.algorithms.modules.selection.Selection`.

This algorithm is equivalent to :class:`~moptipy.algorithms.so.ea.EA`, but
allows for using a customized fitness assignment step
(:class:`~moptipy.algorithms.so.fitness.Fitness`) as well as customizable
survival and :attr:`~moptipy.algorithms.so.general_ea.GeneralEA.mating`
selection (:class:`~moptipy.algorithms.modules.selection.Selection`).
