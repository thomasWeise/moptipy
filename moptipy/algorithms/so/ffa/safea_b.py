"""
The SAFEA-B is hybrid of the (1+1)FEA and the SA with Solution Transfer.

The algorithm combines frequency fitness assignment based local search, i.e.,
the FEA, with simulated annealing (SA). Both algorithms get assigned
alternating objective function evaluations (FEs). The FEA branch remains
unchanged, it is never disturbed and no information flows from the simulated
annealing branch over to it. However, solutions are copied from time to time
from the FEA branch to the SA branch. The solution is transferred from the FEA
branch to the SA branch if its better than the current solution in that
branch.
