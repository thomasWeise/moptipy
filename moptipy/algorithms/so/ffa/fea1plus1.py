The FFA-based version of the (1+1)-EA: the (1+1)-FEA.

This algorithm is based on :class:`~moptipy.algorithms.so.rls.RLS`, i.e., the
(1+1)-EA, but uses Frequency Fitness Assignment (FFA) as fitness assignment
process. FFA replaces all objective values with their encounter frequencies in
the selection decisions. The more often an objective value is encountered, the
higher gets its encounter frequency. Therefore, local optima are slowly
receiving worse and worse fitness.

Most of the existing metaheuristic algorithms have in common that they
maintain a set `Si` of one or multiple solutions and derive a set `Ni` of one
or multiple new solutions in each iteration `i`. From the joint set
`Pi = Si + Ni` of old and new solutions, they then select the set `Si+1` of
solutions to be propagated to the next iteration, and so on. This selection
decision is undertaken based mainly on the objective values `f(x)` of the
solutions `x in Pi` and solutions with better objective values tend to be
preferred over solutions with worse objective values.

Frequency Fitness Assignment (FFA) completely breaks with this most
fundamental concept of optimization. FFA was first proposed by
Weise *et al.* as a "plug-in" for metaheuristics intended to prevent
premature convergence. It therefore maintains a frequency table `H` for
objective values. Before the metaheuristic chooses the set `Si+1` from `Pi`,
it increments the encounter frequencies of the objective value of each
solution in `Pi`, i.e., performs `H[yj] <- H[yj] + 1` for each `xj in Pi`,
where `yj = f(xj)`. In its selection decisions, the algorithm then uses the
frequency fitness `H[yj]` instead of the objective values `yj`.

Here we integrate FFA into the randomized local search algorithm
:class:`~moptipy.algorithms.so.rls.RLS`, which is also known as the
`(1+1) EA`. In its original form, RLS maintains a single solution and derives
a slightly modified copy from it in every iteration. If the modified copy is
not worse than the original solution, it replaces it. "Not worse" here means
that its objective value needs to be better or equally good, i.e., `<=`, than
the maintained current best solution. The RLS with FFA (here called
`(1+1) FEA`) now replaces the comparison of objective values with a comparison
of the frequencies of the objective values. Of course, following the
definition of FFA, the frequencies are first incremented (both of the current
and the new solution) and then compared.

The algorithm is here implemented in two different ways: If the objective
function is always integer valued and the difference between its upper and
lower bound is not too high, then we count the frequency fitness by using a
numpy array. This means that frequency updates and getting frequency values is
very fast. If the objective function is not always integer or if the
difference between its maximum and minimum is too large, then we will use
a :class:`collections.Counter` to back the frequency table instead. This will
be slower and probably require more memory, but it may be the only way to
accommodate the frequency table. Of course, this will still fail if there are
too many different objective values and the memory consumed is simply too
high.

FFA is also implemented as a fitness assignment process
(:mod:`~moptipy.algorithms.so.fitness`) in module
:mod:`~moptipy.algorithms.so.ffa.ffa_fitness`.

    """
    The FFA-based version of the (1+1)-EA: the (1+1)-FEA.

    This algorithm applies Frequency Fitness Assignment (FFA).
    This means that it does not select solutions based on whether
    they are better or worse. Instead, it selects the solution whose
    objective value has been encountered during the search less often.
    The word "best" therefore is not used in the traditional sense, i.e.,
    that one solution is better than another one terms of its objective
    value. Instead, the current best solution is always the one whose
    objective value we have seen the least often.

    In each step, a (1+1)-FEA creates a modified copy `new_x` of the
    current best solution `best_x`. It then increments the frequency fitness
    of both solutions by 1. If frequency fitness of `new_x` is not bigger
    the one of `best_x`, it becomes the new `best_x`.
    Otherwise, it is discarded.

    This algorithm implementation requires that objective values are
    integers and have lower and upper bounds that are not too far
    away from each other. A more general version is available as a fitness
    assignment process (:mod:`~moptipy.algorithms.so.fitness`) that can
