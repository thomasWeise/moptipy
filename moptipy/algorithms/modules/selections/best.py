Choose the `n` best elements from the source array.

"Best" selection is the standard way to perform survival selection in a
(mu+lambda) Evolutionary Algorithm (:class:`~moptipy.algorithms.so.ea.EA`).
It basically sorts the input array based on fitness and then copies the first
`n` elements to the output array. The algorithm is not random but
deterministic, i.e., it will always select each of the `n` best records
exactly once.

This selection is also often called "mu+lambda," "mu,lambda," or "top-n"
selection. It is similar to the selection scheme in Eshelman's CHC algorithm.
A randomized version of this algorithm is called "truncation selection" in the
paper of Blickle and Thiele.
