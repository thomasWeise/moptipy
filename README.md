## 1. Introduction

This will be a library with implementations of metaheuristic optimization methods in Python&nbsp;3.9.
The framework, [algorithm implementations](#41-implemented-algorithms), and the library design is intended to accompany the university course book [Optimization Algorithms](https://thomasweise.github.io/oa/) which I am currently working on.
They are all structured from an educational and learning perspective, but still with performance, ease-of-use, and generality in mind.

Metaheuristic optimization algorithms are methods for solving hard problems.
Here we provide an API that can be used to implement them and to experiment with them.

A metaheuristic algorithm can be a black-box method, which can solve problems without deeper knowledge about their nature.
Such a black-box algorithm only requires methods to create and `modifiy` points in the search space and to evaluate their quality.
With these operations, it will try to step-by-step discover better points.
Black-box metaheuristics are very general and can be adapted to almost any optimization problem.
White and gray-box algorithms, on the other hand, are tailored to specified problems.
They have more knowledge about these problems.
They make use of the problem structure and can implement more efficient search operations.

Within our `moptipy` framework, you can implement algorithms of all of these types under a unified [API](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html).
Our package already provides a growing set of [algorithms](#41-implemented-algorithms) and adaptations to different [search spaces](#42-implemented-search-spaces-and-operators) as well as a set of well-known [optimization problems](#43-implemented-problems).
What `moptipy` *also* offers is an [experiment execution facility](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#module-moptipy.api.experiment) that can gather detailed [log information](#5-data-formats) and [evaluate](#6-evaluating-experiments) the gathered results in a [*reproducible* fashion](#82-reproducibility).
The `moptipy` API now supports both single-objective and multi-objective optimization.
A set of "[How-Tos](#3-how-tos)" is given in [Section 3](#3-how-tos) and a longer [list of examples](#7-examples) is given in [Section 7](#7-examples).


## 2. Installation

In order to use this package and to, e.g., run the example codes, you need to first install it using [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).
You can install the newest version of this library from [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/moptipy/) using [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) by doing

```shell
pip install moptipy
```

This will install the latest official release of our package.
If you want to install the latest source code version from GitHub (which may not yet be officially released), you can do

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/thomasWeise/moptipy.git
```

If you want to install the latest source code version from GitHub (which may not yet be officially released) and you have set up a private/public key for GitHub, you can also do:

```shell
git clone ssh://git@github.com/thomasWeise/moptipy
git install moptipy
```

This may sometimes work better if you are having trouble reaching GitHub via `https` or `http`.
You can also clone the repository and then run a `make` build, which will automatically install all dependencies, run all the tests, and then install the package on your system, too.
If this build completes successful, you can be sure that `moptipy` will work properly on your machine.


## 3. How-Tos

You can find many examples of how to use the [moptipy](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy) library in the folder "[`examples`](https://github.com/thomasWeise/moptipy/tree/main/examples)".
Here, we talk mainly about directly applying one or multiple [optimization algorithm(s)](#41-implemented-algorithms) to one or multiple [optimization problem](#43-implemented-problems) instance(s).
In [Section 5 on Data Formats](#5-data-formats), we give examples and specifications of the log files that our system produces and how you can export the data to other formats.
Later, in [Section 6 on Evaluating Experiments](#6-evaluating-experiments), we provide several examples on how to evaluate and visualize the results of experiments.
In [Section 7 on examples](#7-examples), we list all the examples that ship with moptipy.


### 3.1. How to Apply 1 Optimization Algorithm Once to 1 Problem Instance

The most basic task that we can do in the domain of optimization is to apply one [algorithm](#41-implemented-algorithms) to one instance of an [optimization problem](#43-implemented-problems).
In our framework, we refer to this as an "execution."
You can prepare an execution using the class [`Execution`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.execution.Execution) in the module [moptipy.api.execution](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#module-moptipy.api.execution).
This class follows the [builder design pattern](https://python-patterns.guide/gang-of-four/builder/).
A builder is basically an object that allows you to step-by-step set the parameters of another, more complicated object that should be created.
Once you have set all parameters, you can create the object.
In our case, the class [`Execution`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.execution.Execution) allows you to compose all the elements necessary for the algorithm run and then it performs it and provides you the end results of that execution.

So first, you create an instance `ex` of [`Execution`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.execution.Execution).
Then you set the [algorithm](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.algorithm.Algorithm) that should be applied via the method [`ex.set_algorithm(...)`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.execution.Execution.set_algorithm).
Then you set the [objective function](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.objective.Objective) via the method [`ex.set_objective(...)`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.execution.Execution.set_objective).

Then, via [`ex.set_solution_space(...)`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.execution.Execution.set_solution_space) you set the solution [space](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.space.Space) that contains all possible solutions and is explored by the algorithm.
The solution space is an instance of the class [`Space`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.space.Space).
It provides all methods necessary to create a solution data structure, to copy the contents of one solution data structure to another one, to convert solution data structures to and from strings, and to verify whether a solution data structure is valid.
It is used by the optimization algorithm for instantiating the solution data structures and for copying them.
It is used internally by the `moptipy` system to automatically maintain copies of the current best solution, to check if the solutions are indeed valid once the algorithm finishes, and to convert the solution to a string to store it in the [log files](#51-log-files).

If the search and solution spaces are different, then you can also set a search [space](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.space.Space) via [`ex.set_search_space(...)`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.execution.Execution.set_search_space) and an [encoding](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#module-moptipy.api.encoding) via [`ex.set_encoding(...)`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.execution.Execution.set_encoding).
This is not necessary if the algorithm works directly on the solutions (as in our example below).

Each application of an optimization algorithm to a problem instance will also be provided with a random number generator and it *must* only use this random number generator for randomization and no other sources of randomness.
You can set the seed for this random number generator via [`ex.set_rand_seed(...)`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.execution.Execution.set_rand_seed).
If you create two identical executions and set the same seeds for both of them, the algorithms will make the same random decisions and hence should return the same results.

Furthermore, you can also set the maximum number of candidate solutions that the optimization algorithm is allowed to investigate via [`ex.set_max_fes(...)`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.execution.Execution.set_max_fes), the maximum runtime budget in milliseconds via [`ex.set_max_time_millis(...)`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.execution.Execution.set_max_time_millis), and a goal objective value via [`ex.set_goal_f(...)`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.execution.Execution.set_goal_f) (the algorithm should stop after reaching it).
Notice that optimization algorithms may not terminate unless the system tells them so, so you should always specify at least either a maximum number of objective function evaluations or a runtime limit.
If you only specify a goal objective value and the algorithm cannot reach it, it may not terminate.

Finally, you can also set the path to a log file via [`ex.set_log_file(...)`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.execution.Execution.set_log_file).
If you specify a log file, the system will automatically gather system information, collect the progress of the algorithm (in terms of improving moves by default), and the final results.
It will store all of that in a text file *after* the algorithm has completed and you have left the process scope (see below). 

Anyway, after you have completed building the execution, you can run the process you have configured via `ex.execute()`.
This method returns an instance of [`Process`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#module-moptipy.api.process).
From the algorithm perspective, this instance provides all the information and tools that is needed to create, copy, and evaluate solutions, as well as the termination criterion that tells it when to stop.
For us, the algorithm user, it provides the information about the end result, the consumed FEs, and the end result quality.
In the code below, we illustrate how to extract these information.
Notice that you *must* always use the instances of `Process` in a [`with` block](https://peps.python.org/pep-0343/):
Once this block is left, the log file will be written.
If you use it outside of a `with` block, no log file will be generated.

Let us now look at a concrete example, which is also available as file [examples/single_run_rls_onemax](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/examples/single_run_rls_onemax.html).
As example domain, we use [bit strings](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.spaces.html#module-moptipy.spaces.bitstrings) of length `n = 10` and try to solve the well-known [`OneMax`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.examples.bitstrings.html#module-moptipy.examples.bitstrings.onemax) problem using the well-known [`RLS`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.algorithms.html#module-moptipy.algorithms.rls).

```python
from moptipy.algorithms.so.rls import RLS
from moptipy.api.execution import Execution
from moptipy.examples.bitstrings.onemax import OneMax
from moptipy.operators.bitstrings.op0_random import Op0Random
from moptipy.operators.bitstrings.op1_flip1 import Op1Flip1
from moptipy.spaces.bitstrings import BitStrings
from moptipy.utils.temp import TempFile

n = 10  # we chose dimension 10
space = BitStrings(n)  # search in bit strings of length 10
problem = OneMax(n)  # we maximize the number of 1 bits
algorithm = RLS(  # create RLS that
    Op0Random(),  # starts with a random bit string and
    Op1Flip1())  # flips exactly one bit in each step

# We work with a temporary log file which is automatically deleted after this
# experiment. For a real experiment, you would not use the `with` block and
# instead put the path to the file that you want to create into `tf` by doing
# `from moptipy.utils.path import Path; tf = Path.path("mydir/my_file.txt")`.
with TempFile.create() as tf:  # create temporary file `tf`
    ex = Execution()  # begin configuring execution
    ex.set_solution_space(space)  # set solution space
    ex.set_objective(problem)  # set objective function
    ex.set_algorithm(algorithm)  # set algorithm
    ex.set_rand_seed(199)  # set random seed to 199
    ex.set_log_file(tf)  # set log file = temp file `tf`
    ex.set_max_fes(100)  # allow at most 100 function evaluations
    with ex.execute() as process:  # now run the algorithm*problem combination
        end_result = process.create()  # create empty record to receive result
        process.get_copy_of_best_y(end_result)  # obtain end result
        print(f"Best solution found: {process.to_str(end_result)}")
        print(f"Quality of best solution: {process.get_best_f()}")
        print(f"Consumed Runtime: {process.get_consumed_time_millis()}ms")
        print(f"Total FEs: {process.get_consumed_fes()}")

    print("\nNow reading and printing all the logged data:")
    print(tf.read_all_str())  # instead, we load and print the log file
# The temp file is deleted as soon as we leave the `with` block.
```

The output we would get from this program could look something like this:

```text
Best solution found: TTTTTTTTTT
Quality of best solution: 0
Consumed Runtime: 129ms
Total FEs: 17

Now reading and printing all the logged data:
BEGIN_STATE
totalFEs: 17
totalTimeMillis: 129
bestF: 0
lastImprovementFE: 17
lastImprovementTimeMillis: 129
END_STATE
BEGIN_SETUP
p.name: ProcessWithoutSearchSpace
p.class: moptipy.api._process_no_ss._ProcessNoSS
p.maxFEs: 100
p.goalF: 0
p.randSeed: 199
...
END_SETUP
BEGIN_SYS_INFO
...
END_SYS_INFO
BEGIN_RESULT_Y
TTTTTTTTTT
END_RESULT_Y
```

You can also compare this output to the [example for log files](#513-example-for-single-objective-optimization) further down this text.


### 3.2. How to Run a Series of Experiments

When we develop algorithms or do research, then we cannot just apply an algorithm once to a problem instance and call it a day.
Instead, we will apply multiple algorithms (or algorithm setups) to multiple problem instances and execute several runs for each algorithm * instance combination.
Our system of course also provides the facilities for this.

The concept for this is rather simple.
We distinguish "instances" and "setups."
An "instance" can be anything that a represents one specific problem instance.
It could be a string with its identifying name, it could be the [objective function](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.objective.Objective) itself, or a data structure with the instance data (as is the case for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem used in our book, where we use the class [Instance](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.examples.jssp.html#module-moptipy.examples.jssp.instance)).
The important thing is that the `__str__` method of the instance object will return a short string that can be used in file names of [log files](#51-log-files).

The second concept to understand here are "setups."
A "setup" is basically an almost fully configured [`Execution`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#module-moptipy.api.execution) (see the [previous section](#31-how-to-apply-1-optimization-algorithm-once-to-1-problem-instance) for a detailed discussion of Executions.)
The only things that need to be left blank are the log file path and random seed, which will be filled automatically by our system.

You will basically provide a sequence of callables, i.e., functions or lambdas, each of which will return one "instance."
Additionally, you provide a sequence of callables (functions or lambdas), each of which receiving one "instance" as input and should return an almost fully configured [`Execution`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#module-moptipy.api.execution).
You also provide the number of runs to be executed per "setup" * "instance" combination and a base directory path identifying the directory where one log file should be written for each run.
Additionally, you can specify the number of parallel processes to use, unless you want the system to automatically decide this.
All of this is passed to the function `run_experiment` in module [`moptipy.api.experiment`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#module-moptipy.api.experiment).

This function will do all the work and generate a [folder structure](#511-file-names-and-folder-structure) of log files.
It will spawn the right number of processes, use your functions to generate "instances" and "setups," execute and them.
It will also automatically determine the random seed for each run.
The random seed sequence per instance will be the same for algorithm setups, which means that different algorithms would still start with the same solutions if they sample the first solution in the same way.
The system will even do "warmup" runs, i.e., very short dummy runs with the algorithms that are just used to make sure that the interpreter has seen all code before actually doing the experiments to avoid strange timing problems.

Below, we show one example for the automated experiment execution facility, which applies two algorithms to four problem instances with five runs per setup.
We use again the  [bit strings domain](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.spaces.html#module-moptipy.spaces.bitstrings).
We explore two problems ([`OneMax`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.examples.bitstrings.html#module-moptipy.examples.bitstrings.onemax) and [`LeadingOnes`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.examples.bitstrings.html#module-moptipy.examples.bitstrings.leadingones)) of two different sizes each, leading to four problem instances in total.
We apply the well-known [`RLS`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.algorithms.html#module-moptipy.algorithms.rls) as well as the trivial [random sampling](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.algorithms.html#module-moptipy.algorithms.random_sampling).

The code below is available as file [examples/experiment_2_algorithms_4_problems](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/examples/experiment_2_algorithms_4_problems.html).
Besides executing the experiment, it also prints the end results obtained from parsing the log files (see [Section 5.2.](#52-end-result-csv-files) for more information).

```python
from moptipy.algorithms.so.rls import RLS

            lambda: LeadingOnes(32)]  # 32-dimensional LeadingOnes

    return ex

    ex.set_algorithm(RandomSampling(Op0Random()))
    ex.set_max_fes(100)
    return ex


# We execute the whole experiment in a temp directory.
# For a real experiment, you would put an existing directory path in `td`
# by doing `from moptipy.utils.path import Path; td = Path.directory("mydir")`
# and not use the `with` block.
with TempDir.create() as td:  # create temporary directory `td`
    run_experiment(base_dir=td,  # set the base directory for log files
                   instances=problems,  # define the problem instances
                   setups=[make_rls,  # provide RLS run creator
                           make_random_sampling],  # provide RS run creator
                   n_runs=5,  # we will execute 5 runs per setup
                   n_threads=1)  # we use only a single thread here

    EndResult.from_logs(  # parse all log files and print end results
        td, lambda er: print(f"{er.algorithm} on {er.instance}: {er.best_f}"))
# The temp directory is deleted as soon as we leave the `with` block.
```

The output of this program, minus the status information, could look roughly like this:

```text

### 3.3. How to Solve an Optimization Problem

If you want to solve an optimization problem with [moptipy](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy), then you need at least the following three things:

1. a space `Y` of possible solutions,
2. an objective function `f`  rating the solutions, i.e., which maps elements `y` of `Y` to either integer or float numbers, where *smaller* values are better, and
3. an optimization algorithm that navigates through `Y` and tries to find solutions `y` in `Y` with low corresponding values `f(y)`.

You may need more components, but if you have these three, then you can [run an experiment](#32-how-to-run-a-series-of-experiments).


#### 3.3.1. Define a New Problem Type

At the core of all optimization problems lies the objective function.
All objective functions in `moptipy` are instances of the class [Objective](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.objective.Objective).
If you want to add a new optimization problem, you must derive a new subclass from this class. 

There are two functions you must implement:

- [`evaluate(x)`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.objective.Objective.evaluate) receives a candidate solution `x` as input and must return either an `int` or a `float` rating its quality (smaller values are *better*) and
- `__str__()` returns a string representation of the objective function and may be used in file names and folder structures (depending on how you execute your experiments).
  It therefore must not contain spaces and other dodgy characters.

Additionally, you *may* implement the following two functions

- [`lower_bound()`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.objective.Objective.lower_bound) returns either an `int` or a `float` with the lower bound of the objective value.
  This value does not need to be an objective value that can actually be reached, but if you implement this function, then the value must be small enough so that it is *impossible* to ever reach a smaller objective value.
  If we execute an experiment and no goal objective value is specified, then the system will automatically use this lower bound if it is present.
  Then, if any solution `x` with `f.evaluate(x)==f.lower_bound()` is encountered, the optimization process is automatically stopped.
  Furthermore, after the optimization process is stopped, it is verified that the final solution does not have an objective value smaller than the lower bound.
  If it does, then we throw an exception.
- [`upper_bound()`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.objective.Objective.upper_bound) returns either an `int` or a `float` with the upper bound of the objective value.
  This value does not need to be an objective value that can actually be reached, but if you implement this function, then the value must be large enough so that it is *impossible* to ever reach a larger objective value.
  This function, if present, is used to validate the objective value of the final result of the optimization process.

OK, with this information we are basically able to implement our own problem.
Here, we define the task "sort n numbers" as optimization problem.
Basically, we want that our optimization algorithm works on [permutations](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.spaces.html#module-moptipy.spaces.permutations) of `n` numbers and is searching for the sorted permutation.
As objective value, we count the number of "sorting errors" in a permutation.
If the number at index `i` is bigger than the number at index `i+1`, then this is a sorting error.
If `n=5`, then the permutation `0;1;2;3;4` has no sorting error, i.e., the best possible objective value `0`.
The permutation `4;3;2;1;0` has `n-1=4` sorting errors, i.e., is the worst possible solution.
The permutation `3;4;2;0;1` as `2` sorting errors.

From these thoughts, we also know that we can implement `lower_bound()` to return 0 and `upper_bound()` to return `n-1`.
`__str__` could be `"sort" + n`, i.e., `sort5` in the above example where `n=5`.

We provide the corresponding code in [Section 3.3.3](#333-applying-an-own-algorithm-to-an-own-problem) below.


#### 3.3.2. Define a New Algorithm

While `moptipy` comes with several well-known algorithms out-of-the-box, you can of course also implement your own [algorithms](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.algorithm.Algorithm).
These can then make use of the existing [spaces](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.space.Space) and [search operators](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#module-moptipy.api.operators) &ndash; or not.
Let us here create an example algorithm implementation that does *not* use any of the pre-defined [search operators](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#module-moptipy.api.operators).

All optimization algorithms must be subclasses of the class [Algorithm](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.algorithm.Algorithm).
Each of them must implement two methods:

- [`solve(process)`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.algorithm.Algorithm.solve) receives an instance of [`Process`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#module-moptipy.api.process), which provides the operations to work with the search space, to evaluate solutions, the termination criterion, and the random number generator.
- `__str__()` must return a short string representation identifying the algorithm and its setup.
  This string will be used in file and folder names and therefore must not contain spaces or otherwise dodgy characters.

The instance `process` of [`Process`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#module-moptipy.api.process) passed to the function [`solve`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.algorithm.Algorithm.solve) is a key element of our `moptipy` API.
If the algorithm needs a data structure to hold a point in the search space, it should invoke [`process.create()`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.space.Space.create).
If it needs to copy the point `source` to the point `dest`, it should invoke [`process.copy(dest, source)`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.space.Space.copy).

If it wants to know the quality of the point `x`, it should invoke [`process.evaluate(x)`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.process.Process.evaluate).
This function will actually forward the call to the actual objective function (see, e.g., [Section 3.3.1](#331-define-a-new-problem-type) above).
However, it will do more:
It will automatically keep track of the best-so-far solution and, if needed, build logging information in memory.

Before every single call to [`process.evaluate()`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.process.Process.evaluate), you should invoke [`process.should_terminate()`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.process.Process.should_terminate).
This function returns `True` if the optimization algorithm should stop whatever it is doing and return.
This can happen when a solution of sufficiently good quality is reached, when the maximum number of FEs is exhausted, or when the computational budget in terms of runtime is exhausted.

Since many optimization algorithms make random choices, the function [`process.get_random()`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.process.Process.get_random) returns a [random number generator](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generator.html).
This generator *must* be the only source of randomness used by an algorithm.
It will automatically be seeded by our system, allowing for repeatable and reproducible runs.

The `process` also can provide information about the best-so-far solution, the consumed runtime and FEs, as well as when the last improvement was achieved.
Anyway, all interaction between the algorithm and the actual optimization algorithm will happen through the `process` object.

Equipped with this information, we can develop a simple and rather stupid algorithm to attack the sorting problem.
The search space that we use are the [permutations](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.spaces.html#module-moptipy.spaces.permutations) of `n` numbers.
(These will be internally represented as [numpy `ndarray`s](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.ndarray.html), but we do not need to bother with this, as we this is done automatically for us.) 
Our algorithm should start with allocating a point `x_cur` in the search space, filling it with the numbers `0..n-1`, and shuffling it randomly.
For the shuffling, it will use than random number generator provided by `process`.
It will evaluate this solution and remember its quality in variable `f_cur`.
It will also allocate a second container `x_new` for permutations.

In each step, our algorithm will copy `x_cur` to `x_new`.
Then, it will use the random number generator to draw two numbers `i` and `j` from `0..n-1`.
It will swap the two numbers at these indices in `x_new`, i.e., exchange `x_new[i], x_new[j] = x_new[j], x_new[i]`.
We then evaluate `x_new` and if the resulting objective value `f_new` is better than `f_cur`, we swap `x_new` and `x_cur` (which is faster than copying `x_new` to `x_cur`) and store `f_new` in `f_cur`.
We repeat this until [`process.should_terminate()`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.process.Process.should_terminate) becomes `True`.
All of this is implemented in the source code example below in [Section 3.3.3](#333-applying-an-own-algorithm-to-an-own-problem).

Finally, as a side note:
Our system can automatically store the results of optimization processes in [log file](#51-log-files).
The `process` API also allows your algorithm to store additional information in these files:
You can create a [section](#512-log-file-sections) with a given `title` in the log files that should contain one single string `text` by calling  [`process.add_log_section(title, text)`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.process.Process.add_log_section).
Make sure that all section `title`s are unique.
All such sections will be appended at the end of the log files, wrapped in `BEGIN_title` and `END_title` markers, as prescribed by [our log file format](#512-log-file-sections).


#### 3.3.3. Applying an Own Algorithm to an Own Problem

The following code combines our [own algorithm](#332-define-a-new-algorithm) and our [own problem type](#331-define-a-new-problem-type) that we discussed in the prior two sections and executes an experiment.
It is available as file [examples/experiment_own_algorithm_and_problem](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/examples/experiment_own_algorithm_and_problem.html).
Notice how we provide functions for generating both the problem instances (here the objective functions) and the algorithm setups exactly as we described in [Section 3.2.](#32-how-to-run-a-series-of-experiments) above.

## 4. Implemented Algorithms, Search Spaces, and Problems

Here we list the [algorithms](#41-implemented-algorithms), [search spaces](#42-implemented-search-spaces-and-operators), and [optimization problems](#43-implemented-problems) that we implement in our `moptipy` framework.


### 4.1. Implemented Algorithms

1. [Single Random Sample](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.algorithms.html#moptipy.algorithms.single_random_sample.SingleRandomSample) creates and evaluates exactly one single random solution.
2. [Random Sampling](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.algorithms.html#moptipy.algorithms.random_sampling.RandomSampling) keeps creating random solutions until the computational budget is exhausted.
3. [Random Walk](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.algorithms.html#moptipy.algorithms.random_walk.RandomWalk) creates a random solution and then keeps applying the unary search operator and always accepts the result.

#### 4.1.1. Single-Objective Optimization

1. Simple [Hill Climber](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.algorithms.so.html#moptipy.algorithms.so.hill_climber.HillClimber) creates a random solution as initial best-so-far solution and then iteratively applies the unary search operator to the best-so-far solution. When the result of the unary operator is better, it becomes the new best-so-far solution, otherwise it is discarded.
2. [Hill Climber with Restarts](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.algorithms.so.html#moptipy.algorithms.so.hill_climber_with_restarts.HillClimberWithRestarts) works exactly like the hill climber, but restarts at a new random solution after a fixed number of unsuccessful moves.
3. [Random Local Search / (1+1)-EA](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.algorithms.so.html#moptipy.algorithms.so.rls.RLS) (RLS) works like the [hill climber](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.algorithms.so.html#moptipy.algorithms.so.hill_climber.HillClimber) as well, but accepts a new solution if it is *not worse* than the best-so-far solution (instead of requiring it to be strictly *better*, as the hill climber does).
4. [(mu+lambda)-EA](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.algorithms.so.html#moptipy.algorithms.so.ea.EA) is a simple population-based metaheuristic that starts with a population of `mu` random solutions. In each iteration, it retains only the `mu` best solutions from the population ("best" in terms of the objective value, ties are broken such that newer solutions are preferred). It then applies the unary operator and the binary operator to generate `lambda` new solutions and adds them to the population. The `(1+1)-EA` with `br=0` probability to use the binary operator is equivalent to [RLS](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.algorithms.html#moptipy.algorithms.rls.RLS). 
5. [General EA](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.algorithms.so.html#moptipy.algorithms.so.general_ea.GeneralEA) a generalized version of the (mu+lambda)-EA that can additionally be configured with a [fitness assignment process](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.algorithms.so.fitnesses.html) and both survival and mating [selection algorithms](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.algorithms.modules.html#module-moptipy.algorithms.modules.selection).


#### 4.1.2. Multi-Objective Optimization

1. [Multi-Objective Random Local Search](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.algorithms.mo.html#moptipy.algorithms.mo.morls.MORLS) (MORLS) works exactly as [RLS](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.algorithms.html#moptipy.algorithms.rls.RLS), but it accepts a solution if it is not dominated by the current solution.
2. The [Fast Elitist Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.algorithms.mo.html#moptipy.algorithms.mo.nsga2.NSGA2) (NSGA-II) is maybe the most popular multi-objective evolutionary algorithm.


### 4.2. Implemented Search Spaces and Operators

1. [Bit Strings](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.spaces.html#moptipy.spaces.bitstrings.BitStrings) of a fixed length `n`:
    - Nullary Operators:
      - [random initialization](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.operators.bitstrings.html#moptipy.operators.bitstrings.op0_random.Op0Random) fills the string with random bits
    - Unary Operators:
      - [flip 1](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.operators.bitstrings.html#moptipy.operators.bitstrings.op1_flip1.Op1Flip1) flips one single bit
      - [flip m/n](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.operators.bitstrings.html#moptipy.operators.bitstrings.op1_m_over_n_flip.Op1MoverNflip.op1) flips each bit independently with probability `m/n`
    - Binary Operators:
      - [uniform crossover](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.operators.bitstrings.html#moptipy.operators.bitstrings.op2_uniform.Op2Uniform) randomly chooses, for each bit, from which of the two source strings it will be copied
2. [Permutations](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.spaces.html#moptipy.spaces.permutations.Permutations) (with and without Repetitions):
    - Nullary Operators:
      - [Fisher-Yates shuffle](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.operators.permutations.html#moptipy.operators.permutations.op0_shuffle.Op0Shuffle) creates uniformly randomly distributed permutations
    - Unary Operators:
      - [swap 2](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.operators.permutations.html#moptipy.operators.permutations.op1_swap2.Op1Swap2) swaps exactly two (different) values
      - [swap n](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.operators.permutations.html#moptipy.operators.permutations.op1_swapn.Op1SwapN) performs a random number of swaps
    - Binary Operators:
      - [generalized alternating position crossover](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.operators.permutations.html#moptipy.operators.permutations.op2_gap.Op2GeneralizedAlternatingPosition) chooses, for each index, from which of the two source permutations the (next not-yet-used) value should be copied
      - [order-based crossover](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.operators.permutations.html#moptipy.operators.permutations.op2_ox2.Op2OrderBased) randomly selects a set of indices and copies the elements from first source permutation to the same indices in the destination string. It then copies the remaining elements from the second source, maintaining the order in which they appear in the second source string.
3. [unbounded](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.spaces.html#moptipy.spaces.vectorspace.VectorSpace) and [bounded](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.spaces.html#moptipy.spaces.bounded_vectorspace.BoundedVectorSpace) n-dimensional spaces of real numbers.


### 4.3. Implemented Problems

1. [Bit Strings](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.spaces.html#moptipy.spaces.bitstrings.BitStrings) of a fixed length `n`:
    - The minimization version of the well-known [OneMax](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.examples.bitstrings.html#moptipy.examples.bitstrings.onemax.OneMax) problem, where the goal is to maximize the number of `True` bits in a string.
    - The minimization version of the well-known [LeadingOnes](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.examples.bitstrings.html#moptipy.examples.bitstrings.leadingones.LeadingOnes) problem, where the goal is to maximize the length of the trailing substring of all `True` bits.
    - The minimization version of the [1D Ising Model](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.examples.bitstrings.html#moptipy.examples.bitstrings.ising1d.Ising1d), where the goal is to ensure that all bits have the same values as their neighbors.
2. [Permutations](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.spaces.html#moptipy.spaces.permutations.Permutations) (with and without Repetitions):
    - The NP-hard Job Shop Scheduling Problem ([JSSP](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.examples.jssp.html#module-moptipy.examples.jssp)), where the goal is to find an assignment of jobs to machines with the minimum makespan.
      On <https://thomasweise.github.io/oa_data/>, we provide several zip archives with results obtained with `moptipy` on the JSSP.


## 5. Data Formats

We develop several data formats to store and evaluate the results of computational experiments with our `moptipy` software.
Here you can find their basic definitions.
On <https://thomasweise.github.io/oa_data/>, we provide several zip archives with results obtained with our software.
For example, you could download the [results](https://thomasweise.github.io/oa_data/jssp/jssp_hcr_swapn.tar.xz) of the [hill climber with restarts](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.algorithms.html#module-moptipy.algorithms.hill_climber_with_restarts) on the Job Shop Scheduling Problem ([JSSP](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.examples.jssp.html#module-moptipy.examples.jssp)) using the [operator `swapn`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.operators.permutations.html#module-moptipy.operators.permutations.op1_swapn) that swaps a randomly chosen number of (different) job IDs, for different restart settings.
The files and folders in this archive will then exactly comply to the structure discussed here.

### 5.1. Log Files

The philosophy of our log files are:

1. One log file per algorithm run.
   We always store each run of an algorithm into a single, separate file.
   This has several advantages:
   If you execute several runs in parallel, there cannot be any problems when writing the log files.
   If, instead, we would store multiple runs in a single file, then some synchronization is needed if multiple processes work on the runs for the same setup.
   Each log file and run is also self-contained.
   If runs are executed in a distributed fashion, then we can store data about the node where the run is executed in the log file.
   We can also store the results of the runs right in the log files without requiring any special treatment to identify to which run the results belong (because there only is one run they could belong to).
   And so on.
2. Each log file contains all information needed to fully understand the algorithm run, such as
   1. The results in numerical form, e.g., the [best achieved objective value](#5122-the-section-state).
   2. The result in textual form, e.g., the textual representation of the [best solution discovered](#5125-the-result_-sections)
      This allows us to later load, use, or validate the result.
   3. The [random seed](#5123-the-section-setup) used.
   4. The [termination criteria](#5123-the-section-setup) used, i.e., the maximum objective function evaluations or the maximum runtime or the goal objective value.
   5. The algorithm name and [configuration](#5123-the-section-setup).
      This allows us to later understand what we did here and to reproduce the algorithm setup.
   6. The problem instance name and [parameters](#5123-the-section-setup).
      This makes sure that we know which problem instance did we solve.
   7. The [system configuration](#5124-the-section-sys_info), such as the CPU nd operating system and Python version and [library versions](#5124-the-section-sys_info).
      We need to this to understand and reproduce time-dependent measures or to understand situations where changes in the underlying system configuration may have led to different results.
   8. [Errors](#5126-the-error_-sections), if any occurred.
      We can guard against errors using [unit tests](#81-unit-tests), but it may still happen that a run of the optimization algorithm crashed.
      Our system tries to catch as detailed error information as possible and store it in the log files in order to allow us to figure out what went wrong.
   9. The [progress](#5121-the-section-progress) that the algorithm made over time, if capturing this information [was demanded](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.execution.Execution.set_log_improvements).
   10. The [contents of the archive](#5128-the-archive_j_x-and-archive_j_y-sections) of non-dominated solutions, if we perform [multi-objective optimization](#514-example-log-file-for-multi-objective-optimization).
   11. The [objective values](#5127-the-archive_qualities-section) of the solutions in the archive of non-dominated solutions, if we perform [multi-objective optimization](#514-example-log-file-for-multi-objective-optimization).

All of this information is stored (almost) automatically.
Experiments with `moptipy` are intended to be self-documenting, such that you can still see what was going on if you open a log file of someone else or one of your log files five years after the experiment.
Each log file contains all the information, so you will not end up with a situation where you have a "results file" but cannot find the matching setup information because it was stored elsewhere.

By capturing and storing as much information about the setup, configuration, and parameters of each run automatically, we also try to prevent situations where a vital piece of information turns out to be missing some time after the experiment.
For example, the library author himself has encountered situations where he still, e.g., had the result of a run but did not store how long it took to get it.
And did no longer remember when this information was needed.
In such a case we have no choice but to repeat the experiment.
Unless our system is clever enough to automatically store such data.
`moptipy` is &#x1F601;.


#### 5.1.1. File Names and Folder Structure

One independent run of an algorithm on one problem instance produces one log file.
Each run is identified by the algorithm that is applied, the problem instance to which it is applied, and the random seed.
This tuple is reflected in the file name.
`rls_swap2_demo_0x5a9363100a272f12.txt`, for example, represents the algorithm `rls_swap2` applied to the problem instance `demo` and started with random seed `0x5a9363100a272f12` (where `0x` stands for hexademical notation).
The log files are grouped in a `algorithm`/`instance` folder structure.
In the above example, there would be a folder `rls_swap2` containing a folder `demo`, which, in turn, contains all the log files from all runs of that algorithm on this instance.


#### 5.1.2. Log File Sections

A log file is a simple text file divided into several sections.
Each section `X` begins with the line `BEGIN_X` and ends with the line `END_X`.
There are three types of sections:

- *[Semicolon-separated values](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.utils.html#moptipy.utils.logger.CsvSection)* can hold a series of data values, where each row is divided into multiple values and the values are separated by `;`
- *[Key-values](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.utils.html#moptipy.utils.logger.KeyValueSection)* sections represent, well, values for keys in form of a mapping compatible with [YAML](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#mapping).
  In other words, each line contains a key, followed by `: `, followed by the value.
  The keys can be hierarchically structured in scopes, for example `a.b` and `a.c` indicate two keys `b` and `c` that belong to scope `a`.
- *[Raw text](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.utils.html#moptipy.utils.logger.TextSection)* sections contain text without a general or a priori structure, e.g., the string representation of the best solutions found.

In all the above sections, all the character `#` is removed from output.
The character `#` indicates a starting comment and can only be written by the routines dedicated to produce comments.


##### 5.1.2.1 The Section `PROGRESS`

When setting up an algorithm execution, you can specify whether you want to [log the progress](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.execution.Execution.set_log_improvements) of the algorithm (or not).
If and only if you choose to log the progress, the `PROGRESS` section will be contained in the log file.
Notice that this section can be long if the algorithm makes many improvements.
You can also choose if you want to [log all algorithm steps](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.execution.Execution.set_log_all_fes) or [only the improving moves](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.execution.Execution.set_log_improvements), the latter being the default behavior.
If you really log all algorithm steps, then your log files will become quite large.
In our Job Shop Scheduling example in the [Optimization Algorithms](https://thomasweise.github.io/oa/) book, for example, we can do several million objective function evaluations (FEs) within the two minutes of runtime granted to each run.
This then would equate to several millions of lines in the `PROGRESS` section of each log file.
So normally you would rather only log the improving moves, which would normally be between a few ten to a few thousand of lines, which is usually acceptable.
Notice that even if you do not choose to log the algorithm's progress at all, the [section `STATE`](#5122-the-section-state) with the objective value of the best solution encountered, the FE when it was found, and the consumed runtime as well as the [`RESULT_*` sections](#5125-the-result_-sections) with the best encountered candidate solution and point in the search space as well as the [`SETUP`](#5123-the-section-setup) and [`SYS_INFO`](#5124-the-section-sys_info) still will be included in the log files.

The `PROGRESS` section contains log points describing the algorithm progress over time in a semicolon-separated values format with one data point per line.
It has an internal header describing the data columns.
There will at least be the following columns:

1. `fes` denoting the integer number of performed objective value evaluations
2. `timeMS` the clock time that has passed since the start of the run, measured in milliseconds and stored as integer value.
   Python actually provides the system clock time in terms of nanoseconds, however, we always round up to the next highest millisecond.
   We believe that milliseconds are a more reasonable time measure here and a higher resolution is probably not helpful anyway.
   Due to the upwards-rounding, the lowest possible time at which a log point can occur is at `1` millisecond.
3. `f` the best-so-far objective value, if only improving moves are logged, or the current objective value, if all moves are logged.

This configuration is denoted by the header `fes;timeMS;f`.
After this header and until `END_PROGRESS`, each line will contain one data point with values for the specified columns.

If you perform multi-objective optimization, then one additional column will be added for each objective function.
The column header will be `fi` with `i` being the zero-based index of the function.
`f` then stands for the scalarized version of the objective values.

You can copy the contents of this section together with the header into calculation software such as Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc and choose `;` as separator when applying the text-to-column feature.
This way, you can directly work on the raw data if you want.

Notice that for each FE, there will be at most one data point but there might be multiple data points per millisecond.
This is especially true if we log all FEs.
Usually, we would log one data point for every improvement of the objective value, though.


##### 5.1.2.2 The Section `STATE`

The end state when the run terminates is logged in the section `STATE` in a [YAML](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#mapping)-compatible key-value format.
It holds at least the following keys:

- `totalFEs` the total number of objective function evaluations performed, as integer
- `totalTimeMillis` the total number of clock time milliseconds elapsed since the begin of the run, as integer
- `bestF` the best objective function value encountered during the run
- `lastImprovementFE` the index of the last objective function evaluation where the objective value improved, as integer
- `lastImprovementTimeMillis` the time in milliseconds at which the last objective function value improvement was registered, as integer

In case that multi-objective optimization is performed, please note the following things:

- `bestF` then corresponds to the best scalarization result, i.e., the best value achieved by the scalarization of the objective value vector during the search,
- `bestFs`, the vector of objective values corresponding to the solution obtaining `bestF`, is also provided (values are semicolon-separated),
- `archiveSize` is the number of non-dominated solutions collected in the archive, and
- the values of `lastImprovementFE` and `lastImprovementTimeMillis` may not be reliable anymore:
  Whenever a solution enters the archive or the best scalarization is improved, this is recorded as improvement.
  However, since the archive size is always limited and the archive may be pruned due when it reaches its maximum size, it could be that a solution enters the archive which is actually not non-dominated with respect to the whole search but only with respect to the current archive.
  In other words, `lastImprovementFE` and `lastImprovementTimeMillis` may represent a move that is actually not an absolute improvement. 


##### 5.1.2.3 The Section `SETUP`

In this [YAML](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#mapping)-compatible key-value section, we log information about the configuration of the optimization algorithm as well as the parameters of the problem instance solved.
There are at least the following keys:

- [process](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.process.Process) wrapper parameters (scope `p`):
  - `p.name`: the name of the process wrapper, i.e., a short mnemonic describing its purpose
  - `p.class`: the python class of the process wrapper
  - `p.maxTimeMillis`: the maximum clock time in milliseconds, if specified
  - `p.maxFEs`: the maximum number of objective function evaluations (FEs), if specified
  - `p.goalF`: the goal objective value, if specified (or computed via the `lower_bound()` of the [objective function](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.objective.Objective))
  - `p.randSeed`: the random seed (a 64bit unsigned integer) in decimal notation
  - `p.randSeed(hex)`: the random seed in hexadecimal notation
  - `p.randGenType`: the class of the random number generator
  - `p.randBitGenType`: the class of the bit generator used by the random number generator
  - `p.lowerBound` the lower bound of the (scalarized) objective values that this process can produce (if finite)
  - `p.upperBound` the upper bound of the (scalarized) objective values that this process can produce (if finite)
  If multi-objective optimization is performed, the following parameters are added:
  - `p.archiveMaxSize`: the maximum size of the archive of non-dominated solutions after pruning
  - `p.archivePruneLimit`: the archive size limit above which pruning will be triggered.
- [algorithm](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.algorithm.Algorithm) parameters: scope `a`, includes algorithm `name`, `class`, etc.
- solution [space](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.space.Space) scope `y`, includes `name` and `class` of solution space
- [objective function](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.objective.Objective) information: scope `f`.
  If multi-objective optimization is performed, this is the scope of the [multi-objective problem](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.mo_problem.MOProblem).
  There will be a sub-scope `f.fi` for the `i`th objective function (`i` starts at `0`).
- search [space](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.space.Space) information (if search space is different from solution space): scope `x`
- [encoding](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.encoding.Encoding) information (if encoding is defined): scope `g` 
- [archive pruner](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.mo_archive.MOArchivePruner) information (in case of multi-objective optimization): scope `ap`.

If you implement an own [algorithm](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.algorithm.Algorithm), [objective function](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.objective.Objective), [space](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.space.Space), or your own [search operators](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#module-moptipy.api.operators), then you can overwrite the method [`log_parameters_to(logger)`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.component.Component.log_parameters_to).
This method will automatically be invoked when writing the log files of a run.
It should *always* start with calling the super implementation (`super().log_parameters_to(logger)`).
After that, you can store key-value pairs describing the parameterization of your component.
This way, such information can be preserved in log files.

We strongly suggest to always do that if you define your own components.
It is a very easy way to make sure that your results are reproducible, easy-to-understand, and self-documenting.


##### 5.1.2.4 The Section `SYS_INFO`

The system information section is again a key-value section.
It holds key-value pairs describing features of the machine on which the experiment was executed.
This includes information about the CPU, the operating system, the Python installation, as well as the version information of packages used by moptipy.


##### 5.1.2.5 The `RESULT_` Sections

The textual representation of the best encountered solution (whose objective value is noted as `bestF` in section `STATE`) is stored in the section `RESULT_Y`.
Since we can use many different solution spaces, this section just contains raw text.

If the search and solution space are different, the section `RESULT_X` is included.
It then holds the point in the search space corresponding to the solution presented in `RESULT_Y`.


##### 5.1.2.6 The `ERROR_` Sections

Our package has mechanisms to catch and store errors that occurred during the experiments.
Each type of error will be stored in a separate log section and each such sections may store the class of the error in form `exceptionType: error-class`, the error message in the form `exceptionValue: error-message` and the stack trace line by line after a line header `exceptionStackTrace:`.
The following exception sections are currently supported:

- If an exception is encountered during the algorithm run, it will be store in section `ERROR_IN_RUN`.
- If an exception occurred in the context of the optimization process, it will be stored in `ERROR_IN_CONTEXT`.
  This may be an error during the execution of the algorithm, or, more likely, an error in the code that accesses the process data afterwards, e.g., that processes the best solution encountered.
- If the validation of the finally returned candidate solution failed, the resulting error will be stored in section `ERROR_INVALID_Y`.
- If the internally remembered best objective value does not match to the objective value of the internally remembered best solution after re-evaluating it at the end, the corresponding information will be stored in section `ERROR_BEST_F_MISMATCH`.
- If the validation of the finally returned point in the search space failed, the resulting error will be stored in section `ERROR_INVALID_X`.
- If an inconsistency in the time measurement is discovered, this will result in the section `ERROR_TIMING`.
  Such an error may be caused when the computer clock is adjusted during the run of an optimization algorithm.
  It will also occur if an algorithm terminates without performing even a single objective function evaluation.
- In the unlikely case that an exception occurs during the writing of the log but writing can somehow continue, this exception will be stored in section `ERROR_IN_LOG`.


##### 5.1.2.7 The `ARCHIVE_QUALITIES` Section

If multi-objective optimization is performed, the `process` object will automatically collect an archive of non-dominated solutions.
In the CSV-formatted section `ARCHIVE_QUALITIES` of the log files, we will find one row per non-dominated solution in the archive.
The first number in the row is the scalarized overall solution quality `f`, followed by the value `fi` of the `i`th objective function (`i` starts at `0`).
The solutions fitting to row `j` of this section appear in the `ARCHIVE_j_X` and `ARCHIVE_j_Y` sections (`j` starts at `0`).


##### 5.1.2.8 The `ARCHIVE_j_X` and `ARCHIVE_j_Y` Sections

In multi-objective optimization, the `process` object will automatically collect an archive of non-dominated solutions.
The sections `ARCHIVE_j_X` and `ARCHIVE_j_Y` contain the point in the search space and the point in the solution space corresponding to the `j`th element of the archive.


#### 5.1.3. Example for Single-Objective Optimization

You can execute the following Python code to obtain an example log file.
This code is also available in file [examples/log_file_jssp.py](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/examples/log_file_jssp.html):

```python
from moptipy.algorithms.so.rls import RLS  # the algorithm we use
from moptipy.examples.jssp.experiment import run_experiment  # the JSSP runner
from moptipy.operators.permutations.op0_shuffle import Op0Shuffle  # 0-ary op
from moptipy.operators.permutations.op1_swap2 import Op1Swap2  # 1-ary op
from moptipy.utils.temp import TempDir  # temp directory tool

# We work in a temporary directory, i.e., delete all generated files on exit.
# For a real experiment, you would put an existing directory path in `td`
# by doing `from moptipy.utils.path import Path; td = Path.directory("mydir")`
# and not use the `with` block.
with TempDir.create() as td:  # create temp directory
    # Execute an experiment consisting of exactly one run.
    # As example domain, we use the job shop scheduling problem (JSSP).
    run_experiment(
        base_dir=td,  # working directory = temp dir
        algorithms=[  # the set of algorithms to use: we use only 1
            # an algorithm is created via a lambda
            lambda inst, pwr: RLS(Op0Shuffle(pwr), Op1Swap2())],
        instances=("demo",),  # use the demo JSSP instance
        n_runs=1,  # perform exactly one run
        n_threads=1)  # use exactly one thread
    # The random seed is automatically generated based on the instance name.
    print(td.resolve_inside(  # so we know algorithm, instance, and seed
        "rls_swap2/demo/rls_swap2_demo_0x5a9363100a272f12.txt")
          .read_all_str())  # read file into string (which then gets printed)
# When leaving "while", the temp dir will be deleted
```

The example log file printed by the above code will then look something like this:

```text

#### 5.1.4. Example Log File for Multi-Objective Optimization

You can execute the following Python code to obtain an example log file.
This code is also available in file [examples/mo_example_nsga2_bits.py](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/examples/mo_example_nsga2_bits.html):

```python
from moptipy.algorithms.mo.nsga2 import NSGA2
from moptipy.api.mo_execution import MOExecution
from moptipy.examples.bitstrings.leadingones import LeadingOnes
from moptipy.examples.bitstrings.zeromax import ZeroMax
from moptipy.mo.problem.weighted_sum import WeightedSum
from moptipy.operators.bitstrings.op0_random import Op0Random
from moptipy.operators.bitstrings.op1_flip1 import Op1Flip1
from moptipy.operators.bitstrings.op2_uniform import Op2Uniform
from moptipy.spaces.bitstrings import BitStrings
from moptipy.utils.temp import TempFile

solution_space = BitStrings(16)  # We search a bit string of length 16,
f1 = ZeroMax(16)                 # that has as many 0s in it as possible
f2 = LeadingOnes(16)             # and the longest leading sequence of 1s.
# These are, of course, two conflicting goals.
# Each multi-objective optimization problem is defined by several objective
# functions *and* a way to scalarize the vector of objective values.
# The scalarization is only used by the system to decide for one single best
# solution in the end *and* if we actually apply a single-objective algorithm
# to the problem instead of a multi-objective one. (Here we will apply a
# multi-objective algorithm, though.)
# Here, we decide for a weighted sum scalarization, weighting the number of
# zeros half as much as the number of leading ones.
problem = WeightedSum([f1, f2], [1, 2])

# NSGA-II is the most well-known multi-objective optimization algorithm.
# It works directly on the multiple objectives. It does not require the
# scalarization above at all. The scalarization is _only_ used internally in
# the `Process` objects to ensure compatibility with single-objective
# optimization and for being able to remember a single "best" solution.
algorithm = NSGA2(  # Create the NSGA-II algorithm.
    Op0Random(),    # start with a random bit string and
    Op1Flip1(),     # flips single bits as mutation
    Op2Uniform(),   # performs uniform crossover
    10, 0.05)  # population size = 10, crossover rate = 0.05

# We work with a temporary log file which is automatically deleted after this
# experiment. For a real experiment, you would not use the `with` block and
# instead put the path to the file that you want to create into `tf` by doing
# `from moptipy.utils.path import Path; tf = Path.path("mydir/my_file.txt")`.
with TempFile.create() as tf:  # create temporary file `tf`
    ex = MOExecution()  # begin configuring execution
    ex.set_solution_space(solution_space)
    ex.set_objective(problem)      # set the multi-objective problem
    ex.set_algorithm(algorithm)
    ex.set_rand_seed(200)          # set random seed to 200
    ex.set_log_improvements(True)  # log all improving moves
    ex.set_log_file(tf)            # set log file = temp file `tf`
    ex.set_max_fes(300)            # allow at most 300 function evaluations
    with ex.execute():             # now run the algorithm*problem combination
        pass

    print("\nNow reading and printing all the logged data:")
    print(tf.read_all_str())  # instead, we load and print the log file
# The temp file is deleted as soon as we leave the `with` block.
```

The example log file printed by the above code will then look something like this:

### 5.2. End Result CSV Files

While a [log file](#51-log-files) contains all the data of a single run, you often want to get just the basic measurements, such as the result objective values, from all runs of one experiment in a single file.
The class [`moptipy.evaluation.end_results.EndResult`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.evaluation.html#moptipy.evaluation.end_results.EndResult) provides the tools needed to parse all log files, extract these information, and store them into a semicolon-separated-values formatted file.
The files generated this way can easily be imported into applications like Microsoft Excel.

If you have the `moptipy` package installed, then you can call the module directly from the command line as:

```shell
python3 -m moptipy.evaluation.end_results source_dir dest_file
```

where `source_dir` should be the root directory with the experimental data (see [Section 5.1.1](#511-file-names-and-folder-structure))) and `dest_file` is the path to the CSV file to write.


#### 5.2.1. The End Results File Format

An end results file contains a header line and then one line for each log file that was parsed.
The eleven columns are separated by `;`.
Cells without value are left empty.

It presents the following columns:

1. `algorithm`: the algorithm that was executed
2. `instance`: the instance it was applied to
3. `randSeed` the hexadecimal version of the random seed of the run
4. `bestF`: the best objective value encountered during the run
5. `lastImprovementFE`: the FE when the last improvement was registered
6. `lastImprovementTimeMillis`: the time in milliseconds from the start of the run when the last improvement was registered
7. `totalFEs`: the total number of FEs performed
8. `totalTimeMillis`: the total time in milliseconds consumed by the run
9. `goalF`: the goal objective value, if specified (otherwise empty)
10. `maxFEs`: the computational budget in terms of the maximum number of permitted FEs, if specified (otherwise empty)
11. `maxTimeMillis`: the computational budget in terms of the maximum runtime in milliseconds, if specified (otherwise empty)

For each run, i.e., algorithm x instance x seed combination, one row with the above values is generated.
Notice that from the algorithm and instance name together with the random seed, you can find the corresponding log file.


#### 5.2.2. An Example for End Results Files

Let us execute an abridged example experiment, parse all log files, condense their information into an end results statistics file, and then print that file's contents.
We can do that with the code below, which is also available as file [examples/end_results_jssp.py](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/examples/end_results_jssp.html).

```python
from moptipy.algorithms.so.hill_climber import HillClimber  # second algo to test
from moptipy.algorithms.so.rls import RLS  # first algo to test
from moptipy.evaluation.end_results import EndResult  # the end result record
from moptipy.examples.jssp.experiment import run_experiment  # JSSP example
from moptipy.operators.permutations.op0_shuffle import Op0Shuffle  # 0-ary op
from moptipy.operators.permutations.op1_swap2 import Op1Swap2  # 1-ary op
from moptipy.utils.temp import TempDir  # tool for temp directories

# We work in a temporary directory, i.e., delete all generated files on exit.
# For a real experiment, you would put an existing directory path in `td`
# by doing `from moptipy.utils.path import Path; td = Path.directory("mydir")`
# and not use the `with` block.
with TempDir.create() as td:
    run_experiment(  # run the JSSP experiment with the following parameters:
        base_dir=td,  # base directory to write all log files to
        algorithms=[  # the set of algorithm generators
            lambda inst, pwr: RLS(Op0Shuffle(pwr), Op1Swap2()),  # algo 1
            lambda inst, pwr: HillClimber(Op0Shuffle(pwr), Op1Swap2())],  # 2
        instances=("demo", "abz7", "la24"),  # we use 3 JSSP instances
        max_fes=10000,  # we grant 10000 FEs per run
        n_runs=4,  # perform 4 runs per algorithm * instance combination
        n_threads=1)  # we use only a single thread here

    end_results = []  # this list will receive the end results records
    EndResult.from_logs(td, end_results.append)  # get results from log files

    er_csv = EndResult.to_csv(  # store end results to csv file (returns path)
        end_results,  # the list of end results to store
        td.resolve_inside("end_results.txt"))  # path to the file to generate
    print(er_csv.read_all_str())  # read generated file as string and print it
# When leaving "while", the temp dir will be deleted
```

This will yield something like the following output:

```text

### 5.3. End Result Statistics CSV Files

We can also aggregate the end result data over either algorithm x instance combinations, over whole algorithms, over whole instances, or just over everything.
The class [`moptipy.evaluation.end_statistics.EndStatistics`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.evaluation.html#moptipy.evaluation.end_statistics.EndStatistics) provides the tools needed to aggregate statistics over sequences of [`moptipy.evaluation.end_results.EndResult`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.evaluation.html#moptipy.evaluation.end_results.EndResult) and to store them into a semicolon-separated-values formatted file.
The files generated this way can easily be imported into applications like Microsoft Excel.

If you have the `moptipy` package installed, then you can call the module directly from the command line as:

```shell
python3 -m moptipy.evaluation.end_statistics source dest_file
```

where `source` should either be the root directory with the experimental data (see [Section 5.1.1](#511-file-names-and-folder-structure))) or the path to a [end results CSV file](#52-end-result-csv-files) and `dest_file` is the path to the CSV file to write.


#### 5.3.1. The End Result Statistics File Format

End result statistics files contain information in form of statistics aggregated over several runs.
Therefore, they first contain columns identifying the data over which has been aggregated:

1. `algorithm`: the algorithm used (empty if we aggregate over all algorithms)
2. `instance`: the instance to which it was applied (empty if we aggregate over all instance)

Then the column `n` denotes the number of runs that were performed in the above setting. 
We have then the following data columns:

1. `bestF.x`: statistics about the best objective value encountered during the run
2. `lastImprovementFE.x`: statistics about the index of the objective function evaluation (FE)  when the last improvement was registered
3. `lastImprovementTimeMillis.x`: statistics about the time in milliseconds from the start of the run when the last improvement was registered
4. `totalFEs.x`: statistics about the total number of FEs performed by the runs
5. `totalTimeMillis.x`: statistics about the total time in milliseconds consumed by the runs

Here, the `.x` can stand for the following statistics:

- `min`: the minimum
- `med`: the median
- `mean`: the mean
- `geom`: the geometric mean
- `max`: the maximum
- `sd`: the standard deviation

The column `goalF` denotes the goal objective value, if any.
If it is not empty and greater than zero, then we also have the columns `bestFscaled.x`, which provide statistics of `bestF/goalF` as discussed above.
If `goalF` is defined for at least some settings, we also get the following columns:

1. `nSuccesses`: the number of runs that were successful in reaching the goal
2. `successFEs.x`: the statistics about the FEs until success, but *only* computed over the successful runs
3. `successTimeMillis.x`: the statistics of the runtime until success, but *only* computed over the successful runs
4. `ertFEs`: the empirically estimated runtime to success in FEs
5. `ertTimeMillis`: the empirically estimated runtime to success in milliseconds

Finally, the columns `maxFEs` and `maxTimeMillis`, if specified, include the computational budget limits in terms of FEs or milliseconds.


#### 5.3.2. Example for End Result Statistics Files

We can basically execute the same abridged experiment as in the [previous section](#522-an-example-for-end-results-files), but now take the aggregation of information one step further with the code below.
This code is also available as file [examples/end_statistics_jssp](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/examples/end_statistics_jssp.html).

```python
from moptipy.algorithms.so.hill_climber import HillClimber  # second algo to test
from moptipy.algorithms.so.rls import RLS  # first algo to test
from moptipy.evaluation.end_results import EndResult  # the end result record
from moptipy.evaluation.end_statistics import EndStatistics  # statistics rec
from moptipy.examples.jssp.experiment import run_experiment  # JSSP example
from moptipy.operators.permutations.op0_shuffle import Op0Shuffle  # 0-ary op
from moptipy.operators.permutations.op1_swap2 import Op1Swap2  # 1-ary op
from moptipy.utils.temp import TempDir  # tool for temp directories

# We work in a temporary directory, i.e., delete all generated files on exit.
# For a real experiment, you would put an existing directory path in `td`
# by doing `from moptipy.utils.path import Path; td = Path.directory("mydir")`
# and not use the `with` block.
with TempDir.create() as td:
    run_experiment(  # run the JSSP experiment with the following parameters:
        base_dir=td,  # base directory to write all log files to
        algorithms=[  # the set of algorithm generators
            lambda inst, pwr: RLS(Op0Shuffle(pwr), Op1Swap2()),  # algo 1
            lambda inst, pwr: HillClimber(Op0Shuffle(pwr), Op1Swap2())],  # 2
        instances=("demo", "abz7", "la24"),  # we use 3 JSSP instances
        max_fes=10000,  # we grant 10000 FEs per run
        n_runs=4,  # perform 4 runs per algorithm * instance combination
        n_threads=1)  # we use only a single thread here

    end_results = []  # this list will receive the end results records
    EndResult.from_logs(td, end_results.append)  # get results from log files

    end_stats = []  # the list to receive the statistics records
    EndStatistics.from_end_results(  # compute the end result statistics for
        end_results, end_stats.append)  # each algorithm*instance combination

    es_csv = EndStatistics.to_csv(  # store the statistics to a CSV file
        end_stats, td.resolve_inside("end_stats.txt"))
    print(es_csv.read_all_str())  # read and print the file
# When leaving "while", the temp dir will be deleted
```

We will get something like the following output:

```text

## 6. Evaluating Experiments

The [moptipy](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy) system offers a set of tools to evaluate the results collected from experiments.
On one hand, you can [export](#61-exporting-data) the data to formats that can be processed by other tools.
On the other hand, you can plot a variety of different diagrams.
These diagrams can then be [stored](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.utils.html#module-moptipy.utils.plot_utils) in different formats, such as `svg` (for the web) or `pdf` (for scientific papers). 

### 6.1. Exporting Data

#### 6.1.1. Export to CSV Formats for Excel et al.

We already discussed two formats that can be used to export data to Excel or other software tools.

The [End Results CSV format](#52-end-result-csv-files) produces semicolon-separated-values files that include the states of each run.
For every single run, there will be a row with the algorithm name, instance name, and random seed, as well as the best objective value, the last improvement time and FE, and the total time and consumed FEs.

The [End Results Statistics CSV format](#53-end-result-statistics-csv-files) allows you to export statistics aggregated, e.g., over the instance-algorithm combinations, for instance over all algorithms, or for one algorithm over all instances.
The format is otherwise similar to the End Results CSV format. 


#### 6.1.2 Export to IOHanalyzer

We also support converting our experimental results to the [IOHprofiler data format](https://iohprofiler.github.io/IOHanalyzer/data/).
This can be done by the function [moptipy_to_ioh_analyzer](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.evaluation.html#moptipy.evaluation.ioh_analyzer.moptipy_to_ioh_analyzer), which accepts a source directory in the [`moptipy` structure](#511-file-names-and-folder-structure) and a path to a destination folder where the `IOHprofiler`-formatted data will be stored.
You can then analyze it with the [IOHanalyzer](https://iohprofiler.github.io/IOHanalyzer/) that you can either install locally or use online at <https://iohanalyzer.liacs.nl/>.
In the latter case, you first need to zip-compress your data before uploading it.

If you have the `moptipy` package installed, then you can call the module directly from the command line as:

```shell
python3 -m moptipy.evaluation.ioh_analyzer source_dir dest_dir
```

where `source_dir` should be the root directory with the experimental data (see [Section 5.1.1](#511-file-names-and-folder-structure))) and `dest_dir` is the directory where the IOHprofiler-formatted data should be written.


### 6.2. Progress Plots

In the file [examples/progress_plot.py](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/examples/progress_plot.html), you can find some code running a small experiment and creating "progress plots."
A progress plot is a diagram that shows how an algorithm improves the solution quality over time.
The solution quality can be the raw objective value, the objective value scaled by the goal objective value, or the objective value normalized with the goal objective value.
The time can be measured in objective function evaluations (FEs) or in milliseconds and may be log-scaled or unscaled.
A progress plot can illustrate groups of single runs that were performed in the experiments.
It can also illustrate statistics over the runs, say, the arithmetic mean of the best-so-far objective value at a given point in time.
Both types of data can also be combined in the same diagram.

<a href="https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/_static/progress_single_runs_and_mean_f_over_fes.png">
<img alt="Example for a progress plot combining statistics and single runs" src="https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/_static/progress_single_runs_and_mean_f_over_fes.png" style="width:70%;max-width:70%;min-width:70%" />
</a>

Progress plots are implemented in the module [moptipy.evaluation.plot_progress](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.evaluation.html#module-moptipy.evaluation.plot_progress).


### 6.3. End Results Plot

In the file [examples/end_results_plot.py](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/examples/end_results_plot.html), you can find some code running a small experiment and creating "end results plots."
An end results plot is basically a [box plot](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.boxplot.html) overlay on top of a [violin plot](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.violinplot.html).

Imagine that you conduct multiple runs of one algorithm on one problem instance, let's say 50.
Then you get 50 [log files](#51-log-files) and each of them contains the best solution discovered by the corresponding run.
Now you may want to know how the corresponding 50 objective values are distributed.
You want to get a visual impression about this distribution.
Our end results diagram provide this impression by combining two visualizations:

The [box plot](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.boxplot.html) in the foreground shows the
- the median
- the 25% and 75% quantile
- the 95% confidence interval around the median (as notch)
- the arithmetic mean (as a triangle symbol)
- whiskers at the 5% and 95% quantiles, and
- the outliers on both ends of the spectrum.

The [violin plot](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.violinplot.html) in the background tries to show the approximate distribution of the values.
A violin plot is something like a smoothed-out, vertical, and mirror-symmetric histogram.
Whereas you can see and compare statistical properties of the end result distribution from the box plots, you cannot really see how they are actually distributed.
For example, it is not clear if the distribution is uni-modal or multi-modal.
You can see this from the violins plotted in the background.

If you compute such plots over multiple algorithm-instance combinations, data will automatically be grouped by problem instance.
This means that the violin-boxes of different algorithms on the same problem will be plotted next to each other.
This, in turn, allows you to easily compare algorithm performance.

In order to make comparing algorithm performance over different instances easier, this plot will use scaled objective values by default.
It will use the goal objective values `g` from the log files to scale all objective values `f` to `f/g`.
Ofcourse you can also use it to plot raw objective values, or even runtimes if you wish.

<a href="https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/_static/end_results_scaled.png">
<img alt="Example for an end result plot" src="https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/_static/end_results_scaled.png" style="width:70%;max-width:70%;min-width:70%" />
</a>

The end result plots are implemented in the module [moptipy.evaluation.plot_end_results](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.evaluation.html#module-moptipy.evaluation.plot_end_results).


### 6.4. ECDF Plots

In the file [examples/ecdf_plot.py](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/examples/ecdf_plot.html), you can find some code running a small experiment and creating "ECDF plots."
The Empirical Cumulative Distribution Function (ECDF) is a plot that aggregates data over several runs of an optimization algorithm.
It has the consumed runtime (in FEs or milliseconds) on its horizontal axis and the fraction of runs that succeeded in reaching a specified goal on its vertical axis.
Therefore, an ECDF curve is a monotonously increasing curve:
It remains 0 until the very first (fastest) run of the algorithm reaches the goal, say at time `T1`.
Then, it will increase a bit every single time another run reaches the goal.
At the point in time `T2` when the slowest, last run reaches the goal, it becomes `1`.
Of course, if not all runs reach the goal, it can also remain at a some other level in `[0,1]`.

Let's say we execute 10 runs of our algorithm on a problem instance.
The ECDF remains 0 until the first run reaches the goal.
At this time, it would rise to value `1/10=0.1`.
Once the second run reaches the goal, it will climb to `2/10=0.2`.
If `7` out of our `10` runs can solve the problem and `3` fail to do so, the ECDF would climb to `7/10=0.7` and then remain there.

<a href="https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/_static/ecdf_over_log_fes.png">
<img alt="Example for an ECDF plot combining statistics and single runs" src="https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/_static/ecdf_over_log_fes.png" style="width:70%;max-width:70%;min-width:70%" />
</a>

ECDF plots are implemented in the module [moptipy.evaluation.plot_ecdf](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.evaluation.html#module-moptipy.evaluation.plot_ecdf).


### 6.5. Expected Running Time (ERT) Plots

In the file [examples/ert_plot.py](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/examples/ert_plot.html), you can find some code running a small experiment and creating empirically estimated Expected Running Time (ERT) plots.
Basically, it illustrates an estimation of the runtime that it would take in expectation to reach certain objective values.
The objective values are therefore printed on the horizontal axis and the vertical axis associates an expected running time to them.
This expectation is estimated based on the idea of iterated runs:
Assume that you conduct an experiment with 100 runs.
Now you want to know how long your algorithm needs in expectation to reach a certain goal quality `f`.
However, you are unlucky:
Only 30 of your runs actually reached `f`, the rest of them converged to a worse solution and stopped improving before being finally terminated.
To compute the ERT, we simply assume that if a run did not succeed, we would have directly restarted our algorithm and performed a new, independent run right away.
Each time we start a run, the chance to succeed is 30% as 30 of our 100 runs managed to find a solution with a quality no worse than `f`.
We would do this until we finally succeed.
This means that as long as at least one of our runs succeeded in the experiment, we can compute a finite ERT.

For any goal `f`, the `ERT` is computed as

  `ERT[f] = Time(fbest >= f) / s`

where `s` is the number of successful runs, i.e., of runs that reached the  goal `f` and `Time(fbest >= f)` is the sum of the runtime of all runs that  was spent until the objective value reached `f` (or the run terminated).

Equipped with this understanding, we can now compute the ERT for every single objective value that was reached by any of our runs.
This way, we will get a diagram similar to the one below:

<a href="https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/_static/log_ert_over_f.png">
<img alt="Example for an ERT plot of RLS and Random Walk on OneMax with 12 bits." src="https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/_static/log_ert_over_f.png" style="width:70%;max-width:70%;min-width:70%" />
</a>

The (empirically estimated) Expected Running Time (ERT) is nicely explained in the report [*Real-Parameter Black-Box Optimization Benchmarking 2010: Experimental Setup*](https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00462481/document/).
The ERT plots are implemented in the module [moptipy.evaluation.plot_ert](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.evaluation.html#module-moptipy.evaluation.plot_ert).


### 6.6. ERT-ECDF Plots

In the file [examples/ertecdf_plot.py](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/examples/ertecdf_plot.html), you can find some code running a small experiment and creating ERT-ECDF plots.
These plots combine the concepts of [ERTs](#65-expected-running-time-ert-plots) with [ECDFs](#64-ecdf-plots):
Their vertical axis shows the fraction of problem instances that can be expected to be solved by an algorithm.
Their horizontal axis shows the runtime consumed to do so, which is equivalent to the ERT of the algorithm to reach the global optimum.
While ECDFs themselves are based on single runs, ERT-ECDF plots are based on problem instances.
They also make the same assumptions as ERTs, namely that we can simply restart an algorithm if it was not successful when it had consumed all of its computational budget.
Like ECDF-plots, the ERT-ECDF plots are implemented in the module [moptipy.evaluation.plot_ecdf](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.evaluation.html#module-moptipy.evaluation.plot_ecdf).

<a href="https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/_static/ertecdf_over_log_fes.png">
<img alt="Example for an ERT-ECDF plot of a RLS on OneMax several OneMax instances." src="https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/_static/ertecdf_over_log_fes.png" style="width:70%;max-width:70%;min-width:70%" />
</a>


### 6.7. Performance over Algorithm Parameter or Instance Feature

Often we want to investigate how and algorithm parameter or an instance feature impacts the algorithm performance.
The function  [plot_end_statistics_over_param](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.evaluation.html#module-moptipy.plot_end_statistics_over_parameter) can do both:

In [examples/end_statistics_over_feature_plot.py](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/examples/end_statistics_over_feature_plot.html), it is used to visualize the [`ERT`](#65-expected-running-time-ert-plots) of a simple [RLS algorithm](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.algorithms.html#module-moptipy.algorithms.rls) over the instance size `n` of the [OneMax problem](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.examples.bitstrings.html#module-moptipy.examples.bitstrings.onemax).
Basically, the minimization version of the OneMax problem tries to minimize the number of `0`s in a bit string of length `n`.
Of course, the higher `n`, the longer it will take to solve the problem.
We apply the RLS several times to the instances of sizes `n` in `1..20`.
We then load the end results and convert them to [end result statistics](#531-the-end-result-statistics-file-format).
All we need to tell our system how it can deduce the value of the feature from an [EndStatistics](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.evaluation.html#module-moptipy.evaluation.end_statistics) and which statistic we want to plot (here: `ertFEs`) and we are good:

<a href="https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/_static/ert_over_onemax_n.png">
<img alt="Example for the ERT of a RLS on OneMax plotted over the instance size n over several OneMax instances." src="https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/_static/ert_over_onemax_n.png" style="width:70%;max-width:70%;min-width:70%" />
</a>

In [examples/end_statistics_over_param_plot.py](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/examples/end_statistics_over_param_plot.html), on the other hand, we apply the same method to analyze the impact of an algorithm parameter on the performance.
We again apply an [RLS algorithm](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.algorithms.html#module-moptipy.algorithms.rls) algorithm, but this time with a configurable operator, [Op1MoverNflip](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.operators.bitstrings.html#module-moptipy.operators.bitstrings.op1_m_over_n_flip), which flips each bit in a string with a probability distributed according to `Bin(m/n)`, where `n` is the total number of bits and `m` is a parameter.
We apply this algorithm for different values of `m` to two instances of the minimization version of the [LeadingOnes](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.examples.bitstrings.html#module-moptipy.examples.bitstrings.leadingones) problem.
We plot the mean end result after 128 FEs (on the vertical axis) over the values of `m` (horizontal axis). 

<a href="https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/_static/mean_f_over_param.png">
<img alt="Example for the mean end result quality over the algorithm parameter m of the Bin(m/n) operator plugged into the RLS algorithm on several LeadingOnes instances." src="https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/_static/mean_f_over_param.png" style="width:70%;max-width:70%;min-width:70%" />
</a>

These plots have been implemented in the module [moptipy.evaluation.plot_end_statistics_over_parameter](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.evaluation.html#module-moptipy.plot_end_statistics_over_parameter).


### 6.8. End Results Table

In the file [examples/end_results_table.py](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/examples/end_results_table.html), you can find some code running a small experiment and creating an "end results table."
Such a table allows you to display statistics summarizing the performance of your algorithms over several problem instances.
In their standard configuration, they two parts:

1. Part 1 displays information about the algorithm-instance combinations.
   For each instance, it has one row per algorithm.
   This row displays, by default, the following information about the performance of the algorithm on the instance, aggregated over all runs:
   - `I`: the instance name
   - `lb(f)`: the lower bound of the objective value of the instance
   - `setup`: the name of the algorithm or algorithm setup
   - `best`: the best objective value reached by any run on that instance
   - `mean`: the arithmetic mean of the best objective values reached over all runs
   - `sd`: the standard deviation of the best objective values reached over all runs
   - `mean1`: the arithmetic mean of the best objective values reached over all runs, divided by the lower bound (or goal objective value)
   - `mean(fes)`: the arithmetic mean of the index of the last objective function evaluation (FE) which resulted in an improvement, over all runs
   - `mean(t)`: the arithmetic mean of the time in milliseconds when the last improving move of a run was applied, over all runs
2. The second part of the table presents one row for each algorithm with statistics aggregated over all runs on all instances.
   By default, it holds the following information:
   - `setup`: the name of the algorithm or algorithm setup
   - `best1`: the minimum of the best objective values reached divided by the lower bound (or goal objective value) over all runs
   - `gmean1`: the geometric mean of the best objective values reached divided by the lower bound (or goal objective value) over all runs
   - `worst1`: the maximum of the best objective values reached divided by the lower bound (or goal objective value) over all runs
   - `sd1`: the standard deviation of the best objective values reached divided by the lower bound (or goal objective value) over all runs
   - `mean(fes)`: the arithmetic mean of the index of the last objective function evaluation (FE) which resulted in an improvement, over all runs
   - `mean(t)`: the arithmetic mean of the time in milliseconds when the last improving move of a run was applied, over all runs

For each column of each group (instances in part 1, the complete part 2), the best values are marked in **bold face**.

Tables can be rendered to different formats, such as [Markdown](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.utils.html#moptipy.utils.markdown.Markdown), [LaTeX](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.utils.html#moptipy.utils.latex.LaTeX), and [HTML](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.utils.html#moptipy.utils.html.HTML).
The example [examples/end_results_table.py](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/examples/end_results_table.html), for instance, produces the following [Markdown](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.utils.html#moptipy.utils.markdown.Markdown) table:

The end result tables are implemented in the module [moptipy.evaluation.tabulate_end_results](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.evaluation.html#module-moptipy.evaluation.tabulate_end_results).


### 6.9. Testing End Results for Statistically Significant Differences (Table)

In the file [examples/end_results_tests.py](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/examples/end_results_tests.html), you can find some code running a small experiment and creating a table of statistical end result tests.
In such a table, a set of algorithms is compared pairwise on a set of problem instances using the two-tailed Mann-Whitney U test with the Bonferroni correction.

The output in markdown of the table generated in [examples/end_results_tests.py](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/examples/end_results_tests.html) looks as follows:

|Mann-Whitney U $\alpha$=0.02, $\alpha$'=1.111\*10^-3^|`rls_flip1` vs. `rls_flipB1`|`rls_flip1` vs. `rls_flipB2`|`rls_flipB1` vs. `rls_flipB2`|
|--:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|`leadingones_100`|9.286\*10^-2^ `?`|8.820\*10^-5^ `>`|3.746\*10^-3^ `?`|
|`leadingones_200`|&mdash;|1.078\*10^-2^ `?`|2.713\*10^-2^ `?`|
|`onemax_100`|4.343\*10^-4^ `<`|5.307\*10^-7^ `<`|8.539\*10^-3^ `?`|
|`onemax_200`|2.096\*10^-5^ `<`|2.463\*10^-7^ `<`|1.783\*10^-3^ `?`|
|`trap_100`|2.035\*10^-6^ `<`|2.813\*10^-8^ `<`|1.250\*10^-4^ `<`|
|`trap_200`|2.627\*10^-3^ `?`|1.649\*10^-6^ `<`|2.453\*10^-3^ `?`|
|`<` / `?` / `>`|3/3/0|4/1/1|1/5/0|

As you can see, we compare three algorithms, `rls_flip1`, `rls_flipB1`, and `rls_flipB2`, on six problem instances, the 100 and 200 bit versions of the  [`LeadingOnes`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.examples.bitstrings.html#module-moptipy.examples.bitstrings.leadingones), [`OneMax`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.examples.bitstrings.html#module-moptipy.examples.bitstrings.onemax), and [`Trap`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.examples.bitstrings.html#module-moptipy.examples.bitstrings.trap), problems.
For each algorithm pair on each instance, a two-sided Mann-Whitey U test is applied.
This test computes the probability `p` that the observed difference in performance (here: end result qualities) of the two compared algorithms would occur *if* the two algorithms would perform exactly the same.
In other words, if `p` is high, the chance that any apparent difference in performance just stems from randomness is high.
If one algorithm was better than the other *and* `p` is sufficiently small, then be confident that it truly is better.
We therefore define a significance threshold `alpha`, an upper limit for `p` that we deem acceptable.
In other words, `alpha` is the limit for the probability to be wrong when claiming that one algorithm is better than the other that we are going to accept.
Since we perform multiple test, `alpha'=alpha/n_tests` is computed, i.e., the Bonferroni correction is applied.
We use `alpha'` as actual threshold to ensure that the probability that *any*  of our `n_tests` statements is wrong is `<=alpha`.

The first column of the table contains the problem instances.
Each other column holds the `p` value, together with the signs `<`, `?`, and `<`.

-`<` means that the performance metric of the first algorithm had both *smaller* mean and median values compared to the second algorithm and `p<alpha'`.
- `>` means that the performance metric of the first algorithm had both *larger* mean and median values compared to the second algorithm and `p<alpha'`.
- `?` means that, while one of the two algorithms had a smaller mean and median value, `p>=alpha'`, i.e., the observed difference was not significant.
- A cell with a dash (&mdash;) inside denotes that the two compared algorithms either had the same mean and median performance, or one was better in mean and the other was better in median.
 Even if we would conduct a statistical test, it would be meaningless to claim that either of the two algorithms was better.

The bottom row of the table sums up the numbers of `<`, `?`, and `>` outcomes for each algorithm pair.

The end result comparison tables are implemented in the module [moptipy.evaluation.tabulate_result_tests](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.evaluation.html#module-moptipy.evaluation.tabulate_result_tests).

## 8. More Features

### 8.1. Unit Tests

We provide a set of tools for testing implemented algorithms, spaces, and operators in the package [moptipy.tests](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.tests.html).
Here, you can find functions where you pass in instances of your implemented components and they are checked for compliance with the [moptipy API](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html).

We also try to extensively test our own code, see the [coverage report](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/tc/index.html).


### 8.2. Reproducibility

Experiments with `moptipy` are reproducible and repeatable if the results are recorded in [log files](#51-log-files).
As stated in the [log files section](#51-log-files), our log files should store all the information relevant to a single run of an optimization algorithm.
First, the log files can store the complete [algorithm setups and objective function information](#5123-the-section-setup) as well as the involved fully-qualified class names.
They also store the [system configuration](#5124-the-section-sys_info), which includes the versions of the libraries used.
This should allow to re-create algorithm setups and system configuration.

Each run of the optimization algorithms on every problem instance is provided with a seeded [random number generator](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generator.html) via [`process.get_random()`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.process.Process.get_random).
This must be the *only* source of randomness used in the algorithms.
In other words, every algorithm must be deterministic and make the same decisions on the same problem instance with the same sequence of random numbers provided by this generator.
The random seed using the generator as well as the [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/) classes of the generator and the `numpy` version are all stored in the [log files](#51-log-files).
The random seed for a new run can be set via the [`Execution`](https://thomasweise.github.io/moptipy/moptipy.api.html#moptipy.api.execution.Execution) builder object.
Therefore, if a given algorithm configuration can be re-created on a known instance, it can be started with the same random seed as a known run.
Since the version information and classes of all involved libraries in the random number generation are stored as well, the same random number sequences can be reproduced.

Finally, the solutions found by the algorithms are also stored in the log files.
Therefore, it is also possible to re-evaluate and verify them as well.
