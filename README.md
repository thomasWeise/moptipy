# moptipy: Metaheuristic Optimization in Python

This will be a library with implementations of metaheuristic optimization methods in Python.
Well, it will eventually be, because I first need to learn Python.

## 1. Introduction

Metaheuristic optimization algorithms are methods for solving hard problems.
Here we provide an API that can be used to implement them and to experiment with them.

## 2. Installation

You can easily install this library using `pip` by doing

```
pip install git+https://github.com/thomasWeise/moptipy.git
```
